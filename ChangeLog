2012-04-16  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	Fix the behaviour of alt-tab and clicking on the launcher icon to just raise the most recently used window, not all for that app.
	
	
	BamfLauncherIcon's activation related code has been updated to be more multimonitor aware (for free I've fixed also some bugs that caused the windows not to be put in spread mode in multi-monitor), and to support both the "Launcher only on Primary Monitor" and "Launcher on all monitors" options.
	
	PluginAdapter's FocusWindowGroup method has been updated to optionally only unminimize / raise and activate only the top window. This code would have been more optimized using a reverse iterator to fetch the top_window, but not to change the whole logic and to allow to keep the previous behavior (that initially we wanted for "long alt+tab") without duplicating code, I've just hacked that.
	Implemented also GetWindowMonitor to workaround the mismatch we had with the compiz' window->outputDevice() and the UScreen values that now we use in the whole unity.
	
	Screencast of the fixed version: http://ubuntuone.com/7YaWciQnaZHfzr35asSz0N. Fixes: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/861250, https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/959339, https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/981795. Approved by Thomi Richards, Tim Penhey.

	screen.

	not by the PanelMenuView. 

2012-03-30  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

2012-03-29  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	The menu/indicators layout can safely be kept and handled as the view's

	PanelIndicatorsView: make each menu entry to use the most space it really can
	
	When setting the maximium width for the entries, we shouold care of the
	current sizes. So basically, if an entry doesn't need to be resized,
	we can just take its width and remove it from the maximum space we have,
	then the space that the other entries can use, is computed using the
	remaining space.
	
	This improves a lot the entries collapsing, and make sure that we always
	use all the horizontal space that we have.

	Instead of climbing up the window hierarchy with XQueryTree. That will improve

	* Reset the state of activated_signal_sent_, following a test in search_bar_->activated.connect(). This let the SearchBar act on the activated signals again and requires the Enter key to be pressed for activated_signal_sent_ to be set by a button.

2012-03-16  Jay Taoko  <jay.taoko@canonical.com>

	* Monitor the state of activated_signal_sent_ and use it to decide if the activated signal should be sent.

2012-03-16  Jay Taoko  <jay.taoko@canonical.com>

	* Fix for bug #956878:
	The hud is designed such that if the first valid option is always selected. When the activated signal is detected early in hud::View::FindKeyFocusArea, the selected button is emitted, and the text entry is still selected as the focus area. Therefore, the hud should not reacted to the search_bar_->activated signal since it alreacdy acted in hud::View::FindKeyFocusArea.

2012-02-18  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	PanelMenuView: Make the grabbing of a maximized window from the panel better.
	
	- The window is be restored as soon as the mouse pointer drags content outside
	the panel area.
	- Once a window is restored it is not placed outside the desktop area,
	unless it fits into it, also it is never below the launcher (when visible).
	In the case that the window is bigger than the available space,
	the top and left borders should be always visible anyway.
	- The just restored window, is grabbed on a point of the top decoration
	that is proportional to the x-offset grabbed on the panel, so if you start
	dragging at the left of the panel, the window is handled by the top-left
	corner, if you start dragging on the right of the panel, the window is
	proportionally handled on the right; this applies only with LIM enabled.
	When LIMs are disabled, we just prefer the decoration middle point.
	
	Added also misc improvements to the PanelMenuView code.

	(set to 120ms now) occurs, then we consider that a click. Otherwise we send the grab_started event
	
	This allows to improve the way we handle the grab event in the panel, and allow to avoid to
	change the mouse cursor if not needed.

	The logic is all here, we need to improve the design.
	However, now when integrated menus are enabled, when adding an entry to

	PanelIndicatorAppmenuView that will handle that.
	The view is also updated everytime the panel title or the active window
	changes.

2012-02-07  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	PanelIndicatorAppmenuView: added indicator-entry subclass to store the Appmenu Entry

	The panel title now reflects the currently maximized window (even if not
	shown yet) or the desktop name.
	The Window buttons code should be final instead, the buttons now reflects
	the status of the most maximized window and are linked to that, so

	crashing, so we can finally be pretty sure if the pointed entry is an IndicatorObjectEntry if it has a
	valid parent IndicatorObject

	Trying to understand how and where changes to an icons alpha- and saturation-value are taking place is material to get insane. By now I've spent many many many hours trying to get behind what's going on. I can't say I fully grasp
	the intricate ways of icons opacity and saturation in class Launcher.
	
	As far as I can tell, there are four valid "cases" for the launcher icons in terms of alpha and saturation. To make it easier for you to follow, have a look at this table:
	
	alpha  |  saturation
	-------------------------------------------------------------------
	|  dash open                             |   0.5   |     0.0      |
	|  dash closed                           |   1.0   |     1.0      |
	|  drop-target (dragging & dash open)    |   1.0   |     1.0      |
	|  no drop-target (dragging & dash open) |   0.5   |     0.0      |
	-------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	So alpha should never be outside [0.5 .. 1.0] and saturation should never be outside [0.0 .. 1.0]. From my investigation it is sufficient to protect only against the lower threshold, where alpha needs to be 0.5 and saturation 0.0

	= Problem description =
	
	If no results are returned from a lens there is no message informing the user so.
	
	= The fix =
	
	In DashView::OnSearchFinished a check is made to see if a message should be
	shown.
	
	A default message is used if the lens doesn't provide one.
	
	There is also a timer that waits for 150ms then hides the
	message, if the search is taking a while.
	
	= Test coverage =
	
	There is an autopilot test for this now!. Fixes: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/711199. Approved by Tim Penhey, Alex Launi, Michal Hruby, Marco Trevisan (Treviño), Brandon Schaefer.

	Add some background operations to the SwitcherController to make the Alt+Tab to show-up quicker
	
	The switcher controller now when initialized setup a lazy timer (now set to 10s) that on timeout will construct the
	switcher view, to make the first time usage quicker.
	
	Also, I've added an idle that will run as soon as the user presses the switcher key combination, that constructs the view in background (and shows an invisible window, since the the ShowWindow operation can take longer than just setting the view visible) to make sure that when the show-timeout occurs everything is already there and it just needs to be shown (setting its opacity).

	I've a branch for filters key navigation too, but the visual design is not ready...

	Fixed the drawing of the radios or checkmarks quicklist menu items
	
	When using quicklist menu-items containing radios or checkmarks, unity draws them incorrectly.
	First of all, the Active logic is inverted (unactive items were marked, while active were not), then the disabled status was causing an incorrect drawing.
	
	This is an example code that underlines the issue: http://paste.ubuntu.com/788515/
	You can see the issue in this screenshot: http://go.3v1n0.net/vhgofi
	
	This branch fixes these issues, and this is the expected result: http://ubuntuone.com/5avZ10Lrd8MFxnBmRIOJfQ
	(of course now it works well also when an item is prelighted)
	
	I've not added a manual test since for the graphic nature of the issue, I guess it's hard to automatically test it (and autopilot doesn't help at all, clearly). So, let me know if this is ok.. Fixes: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/910286. Approved by Andrea Azzarone.

	Adding a simple comment for translators to disambiguate the meaning of the 'Format...' message. This comment will be automatically extracted by the build system, put into the translation template (.pot file) and be visible to translators in Launchpad, providing them more context (bug 926339).
	
	I would suggest following this practice for any translatable string that might be prone to confusion, or if anything needs clarifying to translators. It's just a matter of adding a comment above the line where the translatable string appears - the gettext machinery takes care of all the rest.. Fixes: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/926339.

	As shown in the design mockups and as requested by Cimi, I've fixed some visual issues of the launcher and dash:
	
	1) The right launcher border line should use more transparency and
	should be outside the launcher background
	2) The launcher should use on both sides a padding of 6 pixels,
	and without the right border, it should be 64px wide.
	3) Adjusted the dash position, to make it use the launcher real geometry

	Replace the Unity home screen tiles with a "merged lens view" where lenses can contribute any categories they see fit.
	
	settings: introduced a new gsettings key in the com.canonical.Unity.Dash namespace that controls the order of the results on the home screen. We should consider in a later branch having the sorting logic in FilesystemLenses also use this key (still falling back to alphabetical sorting when nothing is set). It empowers users and OEMs to override the default view on the homescreen by putting custom stuff first.
	
	libunity-core: Added a HomeLens class that implements Lens and Lenses interfaces. The typical use case is to add a FilesystemLenses to the HomeLens which will make it automatically merge all lenses found on the fs. In testing we implement custom Lenses instances and add those to the HomeLens in stead.
	
	unityshell: Removed the tiled homescreen and use a bog standard LensView to render the HomeLens in stead. Fixed a bunch of places where we assumed that Lenses' categories were always only appended to. This is no longer true with the HomeLens. Also important: Fix the SetViewType() calling semantics to the lenses when showing/hiding the dash and when switching between the lenses.
	
	Testing it out:
	For this branch to work you need also: lp:~kamstrup/unity-lens-applications/home-lenses, lp:~kamstrup/unity-lens-files/home-lenses, and lp:~mhr3/unity-lens-music/home-lenses. Add to that latest bamf. Without these you will not see the correct results.
	
	To validate the results: Make sure that bringing up the dash resets the search and shows you a default view with exactly 3 categories in this order: Recent Apps, Recent Files, and Downloads. Then do a search and validate that you have exactly 3 categories in this order Applications, Files & Folders, and Music.
	
	Finally; launch an app that is not a favorite, then bring up the bring up the dash home screen and assert that the running app is *not* in the recent apps category (but showing in the launcher). Then close the app and bring up the dash again. The app should now show under Recent Apps.

2012-01-20  Mikkel Kamstrup Erlandsen  <mikkel.kamstrup@gmail.com>

	WIP: Sort categories on the home screen according to their sorting order defined in the gsettings key "com.canonical.Unity.Dash/home-lens-ordering".
	
	NOTE: This required some bug fixing in LensView.cpp and there are still bugs (crashers) a plenty. Although, the initial view renders correctly, as soon as you change the search we get a crash. The problem seems to be that everything in the rendering has been written with the assumption that lenses will only ever *append* to the categories model. The HomeLens breaks this assumption (and can not even in theory be made to work that way)

	- Change 'Rubbish Bin' to 'Trash' in the Unity shortcuts hints overlay
	
	From bug 920529:
	
	In all the software we ship in Ubuntu we use American English (en-US) messages as the source for translations. These can then be translated to any language or variant, such as British English (en-GB).
	
	In the Unity shortcuts hints overlay, the current message (for the want of a better name) for the place where discarded files go is "Rubbish Bin", which is the en-GB version.
	
	In order to be consistent with the rest of the desktop and with the translations, the original message should refer to "Trash", which can then be translated to "Rubbish Bin" in en-GB and will allow the right translation to be shown in the user's desktop for their chosen locales.

2012-01-23  Bilal Akhtar  <bilalakhtar@ubuntu.com>

	This branch contains the first phase of the implementation of software-center integration with Unity. The complete spec on how it should be implemented, is located at:
	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SoftwareCenter#Learning_how_to_launch_an_application
	
	This branch brings the following changes:
	1) An app being installed is shown in the launcher with a tooltip "Waiting to install"
	2) A progress bar on the launcher item displays the download/install progress.
	3) When the app gets installed, the launcher items becomes usable, and the tooltip gets changed to the app name.
	
	Things which are still to be implemented, in the next phases:
	1) Animate the movement of the icon from the USC window to the Unity launcher.
	2) Make the launcher icon wiggle when installation is complete
	3) Stop the launcher icon from blinking when clicked in "waiting to install" state.
	
	In the meantime, you can merge this branch into Unity while I implement the remaining aspects
	
	Branch Testing instructions:
	1) Make sure Unity built from my branch is running.
	2) Get software-center from bzr branch lp:~gary-lasker/software-center/launcher-integration-lp761851
	3) In the software center branch dir, run PYTHONPATH=. python ./software-center
	4) Make sure that in the software center View menu, "New Applications In Launcher" is CHECKED.
	5) Install a package using software-center that contains a desktop file (like gnome-color-chooser, gnome-mplayer or could be any package with a .desktop file)
	6) Watch the Unity launcher :-). Fixes: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/761851. Appoved by Mikkel Kamstrup Erlandsen.

	Fix SIGSEGV when a window is minimized. (LP: #918329)
	
	The crash was caused by 'minimizedWindows' leaking pointers to windows that had been deleted, and then later trying to dereference those pointers. The reason for the leak appears to be a reference leak in the boost::shared_ptr's to CompizMinimizedWindowHandler. Reverting to regular pointers avoids the reference leak, avoids the crash, and makes the code easier to understand (and debug).

2012-01-13  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	Making unity be aware of user-invisible windows, and manage them correctly.
	
	Fixed bug #784804, but after a discussion with Jason I followed his guidelines to get the things fixed.
	Basically now user-invisible windows (i.e. the ones with the skip-taskbar flag) are ignored by unity unless they don't belong to a sticky application. In that case the application is shown as running, but clicking on it makes the application to run a new instance (while the alt+tab allows to select the user-invisible windows).
	When an application as both user visible and invisible windows, clicking on the launcher icon or the alt+tab gives priority to the visible windows when bringing them to focus, while when closing all the visible windows, the application is hidden from launcher and alt+tab unless it's sticky (and in this case it behaves as explained above).
	Also the user-invisible windows, never increment the count of the running windows (i.e. the launcher "pips").
	
	Read more cases in the provided manual-tests.
	
	This branch also fixes the management of the urgent windows, that with some latest commits were not managed anymore as they should (now they get again priority when the parent application is focused).. Fixes: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/784804. Appoved by Mirco Müller.

2012-01-06  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	BamfLauncherIcon: manage user-invisible windows
	
	Windows that have the skip-taskbar flag shouldn't be managed by
	unity unless there's another user-visible window of the given application
	mapped or the application is pinned.
	
	Also, when performing a click over a launcher icon, if it has currently
	opened only non-visible windows, the application is launched, otherwise
	we give priority to the user visible windows bringing to focus just them
	(this doesn't happen in the case of the Alt+Tab).
	
	When an application with user-invisible windows is closed, we show it
	on the launcher only if that is pinned.

	Fix bug 868120 and bug 872625
	
	We should use one framebuffer object per screen rather than one per monitor. Using one per monitor leads to all kinds of interesting rendering glitches because the plugins expect that paint is clipped to the entire backbuffer rather than paint being contained in one buffer.
	
	This should also fix crashes on changing resolutions, as we don't have the race condition where a monitor paints and an fbo hasn't been created for it yet.
	
	Also adds a testcase now, its in standalone-tests/TestScreenEffectFramebufferObject.cpp .
	
	The testcase is a little quirky because we're trying to simulate what's going on when unity is actually running embedded in another opengl application, which means that we have to use nux's embedded mode rather than testing BackgroundEffectHelper directly. The testcase shows what happens in cases where parts of the scene are blurred and other parts aren't as well as what happens when some parts need updating and others don't (eg, the framebuffer should unbind). There's no automated test yet, but I imagine we could make one..

2012-01-02  Andrey Logvinov  <Andrey.Logvinov.81@gmail.com

	This is a fix for https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/873765
	The problem was that when no RGBA antialiasing was set for "gtk-xft-rgba", unity shell assumed that no font antialiasing should be used at all, even if grayscale antialiasing is selected by user e.g. in gnome-tweak-tool. This resulted in non-antialiased text in unity panel, launcher and lenses even though text in windows is properly grayscale antialiased.
	I added further check for "gtk-xft-antialias" value in case when "gtk-xft-rgba" is "none". If "gtk-xft-antialias" is true, then set antialiasing to CAIRO_ANTIALIAS_GRAY instead of CAIRO_ANTIALIAS_NONE.. Fixes: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/873765. Appoved by Marco Trevisan (Treviño).

	This branch does several things:
	
	1) Changes slightly the structure of returned state information from unity - Children are returned in a tuple with the key being 'Children' by default, or whatever the virtual method "Introspectable::GetChildsName()" returns.
	
	2) Updated a few places in the code where classes were overriding GetChildsName() and either returning "" or returning a null pointer. Classes that don't need to change the name of their children in the introspection tree should not override this method and use the default implementation.
	
	3) Merged the autopilot test code in to the tests/autopilot folder.
	
	4) Added a make target named "autopilot" that runs all the autopilot tests. Currently this is not executed as part of any of the "make check*" targets, since it's kind of annoying to run.. Fixes: . Appoved by Tim Penhey.

	Implemented the design bug #874254 to make a newly opened application to quickly show its menus when firstly mapped using a slightly longer fade effect (now set to 200ms to fade in and 300ms to fade out).
	To work properly, this feature, requires the merge of the BAMF branch lp:~3v1n0/bamf/always-notify-view otherwise sticky applications won't be show their menus when opened.
	
	I've also added some fixes and features to the Animator class, and improved the drawing of the fading panel entries.
	
	Plus, I've integrated the bug #875472, introducing 5 new configuration parameters to customize the fading timings and the menu discover-ability time.

	When a new application is shown, to use different fade-in/out timings,

2011-11-24  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	PanelMenuView: Add a small delay before showing menus on new applications.
	
	We need to add a small delay (now set to 300ms) before showing the application menus,
	after the new application has been mapped. This is because they menus could take
	some time to load, and this would make the fade-in effet bad.
	It also improves the user experience when multiple applications are loaded in a small
	amount of time, keeping sure that a menu is not shown if the application has not been
	kept on focus for a minimum time.

2011-11-23  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	PanelMenuView: display the appmenu when an application has been firstly launched.
	
	When a new application view has been opened we add it to a list of new tracked applications
	then, we wait until at least one of its windows it's activated, and in that moment we
	show the global menus for two seconds.
	When the active application has been changed or when the timeout occurs, the global menus
	continue working like before.
	
	I used a list of new applications, to keep a queue of applications that needs to show their
	menus, in the case that more than one application is launched at the same time.
	
	This code doesn't support the favorite applications yet.

	In the current unity implementation when an indicator is opened, there's no way to send it scroll or middle-click events.

	PanelService: improved clicks handling when indicator menus are opened
	
	Now unity-panel-service ignores any button press event (since we can't)
	check its type, and then we look at the type of the button release event.
	So, when scrolling or middle-clicking over an indicator entry (that is
	not an appmenu item) we send the proper signal to the indicator, and we
	avoid to close the indicator menus.
	
	This allows, for example, to change the volume using the mouse wheel when
	the indicator menu is showing.
	
	This fixes LP: #890971

	This branch adds XPath-like query capabilities to the DBus debug interface. This allows autopilot tests to specify precise queries to retrieve only the part of the state tree they wish to inspect. We don't support the full XPath syntax (far from it!), a brief description of the syntax supported is given below:
	
	
	== XPath Syntax ==
	
	"", "/", and "/Unity" all select the root node of the tree. This is exactly the same as if you had not specified a piece name in the old code (so old autopilot tests will continue to work without change).
	
	Absolute paths start with a forward-slash ("/") and may specify a full path to a node. For example, to get the SearchBar node, a test might specify: "/Unity/DashController/DashView/SearchBar".
	
	Tests may also specify relative paths. For example, to get the SearchBar node, no matter where it is in the introspection tree, a test can use the query string "//SearchBar". Note that this can (and often does) return multiple results (for e.g.- a query of "//LauncherIcon" returns all the launcher icons in the introspection tree).
	
	You can also specify children of a relative query, for example "//Launcher/LauncherIcon" returns all the LauncherIcon nodes that are direct children of the Launcher node - this may return different results to the query "//LauncherIcon" if LauncherIcon nodes are added to the introspection tree somewhere else.
	
	Finally, you can restrict which items are returned by querying a node's properties. For example, to get all the launchers that are hidden, tests can use the query "//Launcher[hidden=True]". Just like previous examples, you can select child nodes this way as well: "//Launcher[hidden=true]/LauncherIcon" does what you'd expect. Currently you can inspect all string, boolean, and integer properties. CUrrently you cannot restrict based on more than one property at once: the following DOES NOT WORK: "//Launcher[hidden=True,otherproperty=foo]".
	
	== Performance ==
	
	I've run tests by querying the DBus interface with different queries and measuring the performance. See the following table:
	
	Old method (current code): 24 mS (average) query = ""
	New method (proposed code): 22 mS (average) query = ""
	New method (proposed code): 21 mS (average) query = "/Unity"
	New method (proposed code): 2mS (average) query = "/Unity/DashController/DashView/SearchBar" *
	
	New Method (proposed code): 2mS (average) query = "//SearchBar" *
	New Method (proposed code): 33mS (average) query = "//Launcher[hidden=True]" **
	
	Notes:
	* This result indicates to me that most of the work is in actually sending data over DBus, rather than collecting & processing which nodes to send. 
	** property inspection is slow since the Introspectable::AddProperties method needs to be called twice - once to check if the property is there, and check it's value, and again when the actual introspection happens.
	
	== Tests ==
	
	There's a set of tests that ensure that the XPath stuff works as expected.
	
	== Points of interest / controversial stuff ==
	
	* I've had to change the scope of Introspectable::AddProperties so I can access an introspectable's properties. The alternatives to this are: 1) call Introspect() instead - this is too slow, since it introspects the object and all children, recursively. 2) use friend classes - this is just plain bad.
	
	* I've kept all the code in DebugDBusInterface.cpp - there's an argument for moving the XPathQueryPart class into a separate file, but it's only ever going to be used here.
	
	* This is my first serious code for unity, so I welcome any feedback you have, but be gentle!

	changes our build system so we provide two targets for tests
	make check runs all our tests
	make check-headless runs only the tests that work under a headless environment (xvfb does not work for our needs)
	
	what is expected is that on headless machines we can run make check-headless || make check; so that we get as many tests as possible, but most dev's need only run make check
	
	also included is fixes to the gsettings favorite backend test so that we run with local desktop files only and run local gsettings schemas

	that is built now can define the geometries of his own entries.

	Use correct memory management and temporarily disable focus handlers when passing
	the showdesktop wrap chain to core.
	
	Core checks for whether or not the window is allowed focus, for minimized windows
	we set this to true because plugins such as scale need to check this value
	to determine if a window should be added to their display lists. However, core
	will set the "in showdesktop mode" value to true if the window is allowed to have
	focus and wasn't already in showdesktop mode by the time the wrap chain is passed,
	but the window is already hidden, so it shouldn't be allowed to be included in the
	showdesktop list, so disable focus handlers such that CompWindow::focus will
	return false

	Maybe fix LP#861143
	
	Instead of explicitly undecorating windows when they are maximized, listen
	for changes in decoration state on PropertyNotify events on the windows
	themselves and respond to them, because we might get the maximization
	event when the window is mapped before compiz has had a chance to decorate
	the window.
	
	Also cover the case where a window is withdrawn and then mapped maximized
	again, where we wouldn't redecorate those windows.
	
	In order to avoid cycling on our own undecoration requests, we set the
	high bit on _MOTIF_WM_HINTS decoration field, if that high bit is
	present and the window is otherwise undecorated, we should treat it
	like it is still a decorated window and redecorate it when
	it is restored.

	Fix unvisible pre-edit text in Dash with iBus.
	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-translations/+bug/663776/comments/77
	
	How to reproduce:
	1. Open Dash.
	2. Startup Input Method(in Japanese, press Ctrl+Space)
	-> emit signal "preedit-start"
	3. Type 'a', preedit text should be render, but dont
	-> emit signal "preedit-changed"
	4. Press Enter, preedit text is fixed
	-> emit signal "commit", and render text in Dash
	
	In code:
	OnCommit signal handler call SetText, then text is rendered.
	However OnPreeditChanged signal handler do nothing.
	
	This branch add code to render preedit text in OnPreeditChanged.
	And at OnCommit, remove preedit text, and reset cursor position.
	
	***
	
	I've also made it so the Dash doesn't tab between Lenses if IM is currently active, as the tab is a saved key for going through options

	Make sure that launcher shortcuts works also using numpad.
	
	I've not yet found a way to make sure the launcher shortcuts works using shift and numlok in the same moment. As you know shift cancels numlock:
	
	NumLock off NumLock on
	---------------------------
	Shift off 1 2
	Shift on 3 4
	
	In other words state 1 = state 4. Any idea about this?

2011-09-29  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	This is based on the design bug #690143 and bug #688117. Basically when we click on a launcher icon that controls windows that are all in different workspaces, we need to check where is the first valid window (not minimized, if any is not minimized) and then activate that window and all the other windows of the same application that are in the same viewport. This patch fix this issue and should also fix bug #838766.
	
	Al this is based on my old branch lp:~3v1n0/unity/fix-688117

	PanelMenuView: add an indicator typed as a MENU
	
	This allows to disable some unneeded features like secondary activate and
	scrolling.

2011-09-27  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	PanelIndicatorsView: support for indicator view typing
	
	Default type is (like it was before) an Indicator.

2011-09-27  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	PanelIndicatorEntryView: Add typing support for indicators view
	
	I basically added two types of indicators that can be drawn using
	PanelIndicatorEntryView: INDICATOR and MENU.
	
	A menu is a little bit less complex and it doesn't handle the scrolling over
	an entry, and supports also the middle-click for being shown.
	
	An Indicator is acting like before, but now supports also a kind of
	secondary-activate feedback. On middle-click down, in fact, the item opacity
	is decreased a little and then restored on button up. This should give
	better usability.
	
	So now it's possible to use the INDICATOR type for all the system indicators
	and the MENU for the panelmenu menus, that now will act exactly like
	the menus of a gtk-menubar.

2011-09-27  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	PanelIndicatorEntryView: cache the texture layer, and use it to draw.
	
	This code was missing in the previous versions by mistake.

	Tuning the rate of the cross fading when switching from menus+buttons bar
	to a title bar (for maximized windows). We increase the fade-out of the
	showing item and the fade-in of the hiding one.

2011-09-26  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	PanelMenuView: setting the fade in/out values as requested by design
	
	Setting the fadein title timing at 100ms and fadeout timing at 120ms as

	PanelMenuView: tuning the title gradient fade-out
	
	If we're fading-out the title, it's better to quickly hide
	the transparent right-most area.

2011-09-26  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	PanelMenuView: Avoid crashes when unlocking/locking the title gradient.
	
	After long time of not using, unity it could crash when overing the panel

	This should fix the crash.

2011-09-23  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	PanelMenuView: quickly hide the window buttons if menus aren't hiding
	
	If we want to hide only the window buttons (i.e. quitting the dash
	or clicking over the restore button of a maximized window), we need
	to do this in a quicker way.

2011-09-23  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	PanelMenuView: on fade-out quickly show the cut title part
	
	When fading-out the title we need to quickly show back the menu title
	part that has been previously cut with fade.

2011-09-23  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	PanelMenu: use a cross-fade effect when showing the menus and hiding the title
	
	Now the window title and the menus are both faded in reverse direction
	to show a cross-fade effect.
	
	It only happens if we show bot the menus and the buttons and the title
	is not faded.

2011-09-23  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	PanelMenu: When the menus are being shown, update the title gradient on opacity change
	
	This allows to get a nice effect, also the title now is cut using
	a progressive mask which increases its opacity following the menu animation.

2011-09-23  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	WindowButtons: don't paintbackground, make the parent do it!

2011-09-23  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	If we draw the windowbuttons, then no title should shown in the panel!

	IndicatorEntry and WindowButtons: no need to clear the background
	
	Since we redraw them from an higher level, we don't have to clear their
	area when drawing them.

2011-09-22  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	PanelMenuView: use the new Animator class to show/hide menus and buttons
	
	Now we animate the panelmenu items using the Animator timer.

	PanelMenuView: Add DrawMenus and DrawWindowButtons utility functions
	
	They allow to check the variables to see if the menus or the window buttons

	Fixed lots of other PanelMenuView related bugs (see the linked list of "In Progress bugs" for reference).
	
	In particular, I've also changed these things:
	- Moving to nux::GetGraphicsDisplay()->GetMouseScreenCoord() (instead of gdk functions,
	warning this needs nux bzr-453 or newer not to crash, thanks to Jay for fixing!)
	- Checking for mouse position after closing menus to hide/show them (bug bug #843670)
	- Checking for mouse position after dragging a window to to hide/show menus
	- Fix for PluginAdapter not to consider unmapped windows as maximized (bug #781215)
	- Panel-service: correctly close menus when releasing mouse outside a menu title (bug #844309)
	- Panel-service: cache the indicator entries geometry and use the values for checking mouse position
	- Don't redecorate windows on maximization drag (bug #838923)
	- panel-service: Remove id2entry_hash and use sscanf to parse the entries IDs
	- PanelView: track mouse position only when it has been changed (fix bug #834065)
	- PanelMenuView / PanelIndicatorsView: remove code duplication for adding an entry
	- Better mouse grab management using only PanelTitleGrabArea
	- PanelMenuView: even more checks to avoid to show/hide menus when we shouldn't
	- PanelView: sync geometries for real
	
	See the related commit logs for more informations.
	
	This branch, to work properly, needs the updated UnityCore code that I've pushed in my lp:~3v1n0/unity/menus-switching-hacks branch (for the entries geometry things), so in the case that the other branch isn't accepted, we need to port its UnityCore changes here.

	PanelView: track mouse position only when it has been changed
	
	We cache the tracked mouse position to avoid to check for changed

	when changing the active menu using the keyboard, the mouse position was
	always checked for opening a menu. Now it's relevant only if it has been
	changed.

	panel-service: Remove id2entry_hash and go back to a direct hash entry2geometry_hash
	
	There's no need to use the id2entry hash since sscanf can do the
	work for us to get back a pointer from its previously generated string.
	This works well and saves memory and computation.
	
	Also it solves the issue with entry2geometry_hash that now can be again an hashtable
	using the direct access and doesn't use memory to duplicate the entry_id
	string

2011-09-16  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	Use a string based hash-table for geometry and don't remove values on entry-removed
	
	When switching the focus from a window to one of its dialog children
	(for example an open dialog, or any other dialog with no proper menu)
	unity-panel-service gets quickly an "entry-removed" signal for an entry
	and then a new "entry-added" signal for the very same entry.
	This causes the panel-service not to sync with the client, since the
	two events are too near and so if in this case we would have removed
	the cached geometries for that entry, then the client wouldn't have shown
	its menu correctly.
	
	So now we remove the entries from the entry2geometry_hash hashtable only
	when the client asked to do that to avoid errors, however we use more
	memory and a slower hashtable since we need to use strings.

2011-09-15  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	Fixing for good the Redecorate maximized windows issue.
	
	This fixes bug #838923 (and particularly the redecorate problem
	also noticed by other bugs like #825230).
	
	Really this is more a workaround than a fix, since in the previous
	implementation of the PluginAdapter::IsWindowDecorated function
	we used the compiz way to get the decoration parameters.
	However compiz is too slow to catch the changes we did in the function
	PluginAdapter::SetMwmWindowHints which actually uses directly the
	Xlib APIs. So, also when querying for the decorate status
	we need to use XGetWindowProperty to get the real value.
	
	The old code has been left there, with a FIXME statement.

2011-09-13  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	Panel-service: cache the entry geometries and use them for parsing mouse events
	
	When a client calls the SyncGeometry method the panel-service caches
	the geometries for the changed entries and then we use them in the
	event filter function to check if a release event has been done
	over an indicator entry name or not.
	
	This fixes for good bug #844309 and improves the menus handling with
	a single-click: when a click is released over a non-previously selected
	menu title, then the release event is ignored, otherwise we use it
	to close the menus.

2011-09-11  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	panel-service: Don't remove all release events outside the menu area on first click
	
	Unity panel service, after opening a menu was ignoring all the mouse release events
	to avoid to close the just opened menu. But this was incorrect and caused
	bug #844309 so it was impossible click on a menu, continue clicking over it
	and releasing the mouse outside its area (to close it).
	
	So now we only ingore release events that are above the menu, so if
	a mouse button is released above the menu (and so in its title in the panel)
	the release event is ignored and so the menu doesn't close, otherwise
	the menu closes.

	Don't consider unmapped and unviewable windows in IsWindowObscured
	
	An unmapped or not viewable window can't for sure obscure another window.
	So, when trying to collect the maximized Windows in PanelMenuWindow
	(to restore them grabbing from the panel), the unmapped windows
	(like banshee in the sound menu or deluge reduced to its indicator)
	must not be considered or the dragging wouldn't work.
	
	This should fix bugs like #781215 and #774121

	PanelView, never use nux::GetGraphicsDisplay()->GetMouseScreenCoord();
	
	It's too unstable, it could causes crashes when the mouse pointer is

2011-09-08  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	This is a set of hacks to improve the reaction of the panel on fast menus switching
	
	Everytime unity shows a menu it needs to contact unity-panel-service and to wait for its reply to correctly redraw the panel (selecting the mapped menu title).
	This is correct, but due to the low speed of this process it causes some visual issues when moving quickly the mouse over the indicators, this gives the impression that the unity interface is slow.
	
	To reduce this feeling I've made some hacks to make the Panel update its aspect as soon as a menu has been hovered, without waiting for the panel-service reply both when selecting and de-selecting a menu.
	However, the panel reply is not ignored, but considered only if our guess was wrong.
	
	This allows to navigate over titles without that the panel will show a "redraw cascade effect" caused by the late replies of the panel service.
	Of course the speed of the menus themselves won't change, but the switch process should look cleaner.

	Only remove the input shape on the client window and send a synethetic ShapeNotify when that happens
	
	We should only remove the input shape on the client window because core will respond by updating the
	regions correctly so that if the shape changes again core will be able to restore it correctly. However,
	we disable XShape events on the client window such that we will not receive a ShapeNotify event
	on the client window for our own operation which would cause cycling in the shape code. Instead craft
	a synethetic ShapeNotify event and send that to the root window so that core will update the window
	region and we can ignore the synethetic ShapeNotify event.

	Some optimizations for clearing empty indicators.

2011-08-09  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	Indicator entries should always be resynced, also if they're empty.
	
	Then the indicator could remove them.
	
	This fixes the issue that I introduced which caused the menus not to
	be removed when a window had no menus at all.

2011-08-09  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	Menus already arrive in the correct order, no need to check for priority.
	
	Also if that could be a nice extra check, I prefer not to waste time here.

2011-08-09  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	Including name_hint parameter in the IndicatorEntry.
	
	Also if actually this is not used by the shell, but only by the panel
	service, this value could be useful in future development.
	
	Updated also the entry tests.

2011-08-09  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	Added PanelIndicatorsView to move to the priority-based system for ordering entries
	
	Removed PanelIndicatorObject and replaced with PanelIndicatorsView that
	basically is a container of indicators which shows them following the priority
	of the given entries.
	
	So, now PanelView just contains two indicator children: menu_view and indicators
	They get updated when a new entry is added and uses the entries priority
	to order them. Thanks to this now the indicators can be also in a mixed order
	and the entries aren't anymore ordered just per-IndicatorObject.

2011-08-09  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	UnityCore: Support for prioritized indicator entries
	
	When an IndicatorEntry is allocated now, we also consider its priority
	flag, as the PanelService sends us that value too.
	
	Also, now we avoid to allocate a new entry at every Sync, but we
	try to use the already allocated instance if it exists.
	Added also the support for removing an indicator entry when
	it's not more synced by the PanelSerive, with signal support.
	
	This avoids that unity will create blank indicator entries, but
	actually it only generates real entries to be added to the panel.
	
	Finally, now we use have an indicator entry priority flag, we don't
	need to order all the entries per-indicator.

2011-08-09  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	Panel service: Add priority flag to indicators
	
	When panel service loads the indicators, it also compute the priority
	of the indicator entry itself. That value then can be used by
	the panel to correctly order the indicators.
	
	Now panel service orders the indicators following the specifications
	defined by the design team, and basically from the end of the screen:
	* indicator-session
	* indicator-datetime
	* indicator-sound
	* network manager (nm-applet)
	* bluetooth manager
	* indicator-messages
	* keyboard layout
	* All the others appindicators
	* The application menus

2011-09-08  Tim Penhey  <tim.penhey@canonical.com>

	Merging in tims branch to replace PlacesStyle with a non-singleton
	
	This branch changes one of our singletons that never gets destroyed
	into a pseudo-singleton.
	
	The PlacesStyle object now uses smart pointers to own the textures,
	and the signal manger to dicsonnect the signals.
	
	Other small tweaks include putting it in the unity namespace, and
	returning the text color by const&, and making some of the methods
	const.

2011-09-08  Tim Penhey  <tim.penhey@canonical.com>

	Makes PlacesStyle a non-singleton, but warns you if you try
	to create more than one instance.
	
	This means that the unity screen can own the style, so it get
	nicely destroyed when the screen is destroyed.

	Merges in Marcos branch that fixes lp:#801413 and lp:843425 and some more fixes/improvements
	
	This branch includes various fixes for the QuickList handling such as:
	- Correct hiding of quicklist items and quicklist roots (including not showing unneeded separators, see more at bug #843425).
	- Support for monitoring .desktop file changes to dynamically update the "static" quicklist generated using the launcher .desktop file
	- Some memory optimizations and fix of memory leaks
	- Fixed a bug causing unity to crash if removing launcher with an open quicklist (bug #801413)

2011-09-07  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	LauncherIcon: Hide a visible quicklist when removing the Icon
	
	If a LauncherIcon has been removed while its quicklist is still showing,
	unity crashes since it's still listening for events waiting a click
	outside the quicklist. Hiding it before removing the icon fixes it.
	
	This fixes bug #801413

2011-09-07  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	BamfLauncherIcon: Fixed some MenuItems memory leaks
	
	Keeping pointers of all other menu-items we use in the quicklist
	to avoid to re-create them on every icon right-click (each time
	the quicklist is shown).
	
	All the used menu_items are now also unreferenced when the Launcher Icon
	is destructed.

2011-09-07  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	Update .desktop file quicklist on file modification
	
	Monitor for desktop file changes and reload the launcher quicklist
	on file edit. Also the monitor is updated when the linked desktop file
	changes (that's BAMF responsability).
	
	Plus, don't update the cached desktop file if not needed and always use
	DesktopFile() to get it.

2011-09-07  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	BamfLauncherIcon: Don't show quicklist items if they aren't visible.
	
	A quicklist menu or a quicklist menuitem shouldn't be considered if not visible
	at all. This would cause to show just a separator leading to bug #843425

	from the list of positioning issues:

	- The magnifying glass inside the search box is positioned wrong (should be
	further to the left)
	- There is too much space below each category header
	- "Filter results" header is positioned wrong (should be right and slightly up)
	- The "All" button is aligned incorrectly relative to the other filter buttons
	(right sides should fall on the same vertical axis)
	
	from the list of shape issues:
	- "Filter results" is the wrong font size and weight
	- The corner radius of the search filter toggle boxes is wrong
	- The 'rating' stars are the wrong size
	- the un-selected 'rating' star has the wrong border
	- the 1px dividers in-between the categories should be narrower with 15px
	margin on each side
	- the dividers in between the filter results categories are missing
	- the 'All' button's shape is very wrong
	- the filter results category headers are with wrong font size and weight

2011-09-02  Jason Smith  <jason.smith@canonical.com>

	make launcher fade out desaturated icons

2011-09-05  Tim Penhey  <tim.penhey@canonical.com>

	This branch fixes a leak in the IconLoader.
	
	The fundamental here is that the IconLoader was using the glib queue.
	However the problem is that the way the items on the queue are freed
	doesn't take into account any of the object destructors, like sigc::slot.

2011-09-05  Tim Penhey  <tim.penhey@canonical.com>

	Merge trunk (and design).

	Change DashController to load lazily, clean up some bits and pieces

2011-09-05  Tim Penhey  <tim.penhey@canonical.com>

	I noticed that quite a few of the memory leaks were do to
	making a texture from a CairoGraphics object. Instead of having
	to remember at all the call sites, I've created a couple of helper
	methods.
	
	I had to control myself a lot during this change to not change too
	many other things at once. Sometimes I couldn't help myself though.
	
	In particular I changed the TextureContainer to use smart pointers.

2011-09-05  Tim Penhey  <tim.penhey@canonical.com>

	Merge trunk.

	Simplifies the internal map and uses std::strings and nux object pointers.

2011-09-02  Tim Penhey  <tim.penhey@canonical.com>

	Add the texture_cache tests.

2011-09-02  Tim Penhey  <tim.penhey@canonical.com>

	There are some disabled tests here as I can't figure out right
	now how to get nux to allow me to create some BaseTexture* type
	objects without an X11 window, or how to fake an X11 window.
	
	These tests have been left in though, in the hope that we will soon
	be able to test this.

2011-09-02  Tim Penhey  <tim.penhey@canonical.com>

	Initialize nux for the test suite.

2011-09-02  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	This branch includes some fixes for PanelMenuView which in current trunk has often some visual issues (menus are not hidden, title is not faded out).

2011-09-02  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	Always restore the mouse cursor on grab end.

2011-09-02  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	PanelTitlebarGrabArea: send mouse_down only on left-click.

2011-09-02  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	Add a workaround to avoid the compiz grid plugin to show the full-screen effect
	
	It happens when you try to restore a maximized window by dragging its
	title down. If the mouse drags the window when it's in the panel
	compiz draw a fullscreen shape of the window, but that's incorrect
	as discussed in bug #838923
	
	A workaround to avoid this is to track the dragging in the panel
	and to activate that drag only when we're out from the panel.
	
	So here we simulate a drag, changing the mouse pointer, then when
	the mouse drag goes outside the panel, the real window drag is activated.
	
	This doesn't fix completely the bug #838923, since that is mostly caused
	by an X race in updating the Window X properties.

2011-09-01  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	Don't hide menus and windowcontrols (if shown) when closing the menus.
	
	Fixes bug #838759

2011-09-01  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	Track the mouse enter/leave for WindowButtons too
	
	There's no need to double the checks for mouse position, if we always track
	where it is. Thanks to this we can always use the _is_inside variable
	to check where the mouse is instead of checking it twice with
	nux::GetWindowCompositor().GetMousePosition()

2011-09-01  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	Fixing bug #838021 causing the menus not to hide after a double-click in the panel
	
	When the panelmenu get a double-click apparently it also gets a MouseLeave
	event and then another MouseEnter event, so we need to force the _is_inside
	value to true, and _is_grabbed to false to make _is_inside to be reverted
	to true when the MouseEnter event happens.

2011-09-01  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	When drawing the PanelMenuView always check for current pointer position.
	
	This caused bug #838479 (when restoring a window using the restore button
	or the double-click over the panel, the application title text wasn't
	faded out correctly).

2011-09-01  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	Fixing again bug #820293 (using a cleaner way) and #835637
	
	So, now the panel view is hidden also when leaving the panel from the
	left edge of the panel.
	
	Bug #835731 can't fixed in PanelMenuView directly, since the it doesn't
	get events when the pointer is positioned on the first screen column of pixels
	(also if it uses that area, actually).

	Cover all the cases where the input shape of the window could be restored
	while it is fake minimized.
	
	Also remove the input shape of the client window too, since of core tries to
	update the frame region again it will read that and we won't get a notification
	about it since it removes the ShapeNotifyMask on the XShape input field while it's
	doing that.

2011-09-01  Sam Spilsbury  <sam.spilsbury@canonical.com>

	Fixes a few of the issues that came up with this during this cycle:
	* Fixed infinite loop issue with windows syncing to each other when the server was lagging behind (requires core patch)
	* Expand / Contract parent window when requested dialog size is larger than the window
	* Fixed offscreen to onscreen movement, move back
	* Changed the way the paint system works - now we collect all of the geometry and textures from a single paint pass of the window and add that geometry to it's parent and paint the textures with the parent window's vertex data, which means that the dialog will actually appear to be "pinned" to the window in every single case (eg scale, switcher)
	* Fixed various placement issues
	* Fixed offscreen dialogs with Qt applications

2011-08-30  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	WindowManager / PluginAdapter add compiz_event signal
	
	This is emitted when a compiz_event is notified by the plugin.
	It's a generic signal, emitter that can be parsed checking the passed options.
	
	It's actually not used anywhere but it could be useful for future usage.

2011-08-30  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	MinimizedHandler: Add static variable to check if we have to handle compiz events or not
	
	This allow to get the same result of the original version, without affecting
	all the UnityShell plugin at all when setting to handle or not compiz
	events.

2011-08-30  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	CompizMinimizedWindowHandler: don't disable compiz event dispatching.
	
	This would cause issues with some WindowManager signals, as they
	wouldn't be emitted any more.
	
	As side effect the launcher would hide/show on viewport switch
	and it would be impossible to detect a viewport switch event.

	Add two more options to Icon BackLight Illumination
	
	They allow to set other two different kind of illuminations:
	- Edge Illumination Toggles: illuminate only the edge of the icons linked to
	running applications.
	- Backlight and Edge Illumination Toggles: illuminate the background of the
	icons linked to running
	applications; if the windows
	of this application are all in
	a non viewable workspace, then
	only the edge of the icon is
	illuminated.
	
	The second of this option has been designed with JohnLea

	we need to draw just an empty arrow. This finally fixes bug #690143

2011-07-29  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	BamfLauncherIcon: check windows's viewport on viewport change
	
	When a viewport switch event has terminated or when the expo plugin
	has been terminated, we need check if the launcher icons are still
	visible on the current viewport. In that case we must update the UI
	accordingly.

2011-07-29  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	Launcher: when a viewport switch event occurs do the needed things.
	
	Code moved from unityshell.cpp for more clarity. When such events
	are emitted the launcher should disable and re/enable the launcher
	showing.

2011-07-29  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	PluginAdapter: suport compiz_screen_viewport_switch_{started,ended} signals

	Detect occlusions and apply this to the region update logic

2011-08-20  Sam Spilsbury  <sam.spilsbury@canonical.com>

	Use and XRegion instead of nux::Geometry to determine the dirty regions
	that need refreshing.
	
	The problem with using nux::Geometry on a flat bounds is something like this:
	
	-------------------------
	|d|                     |
	|d|   |bbbbbbbbbb|      |
	|     |bbbbbbbbbb|      |
	|                     |d|
	-------------------------
	
	Will result in 
	
	-------------------------
	|d|rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr|
	|d|rrr|bbbbbbbbbb|rrrrrr|
	|rrrrr|bbbbbbbbbb|rrrrrr|
	|rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr|d|
	-------------------------
	
	Rather than
	
	-------------------------
	|r|                     |
	|r|   |bbbbbbbbbb|      |
	|     |bbbbbbbbbb|      |
	|                     |r|
	-------------------------
	
	Causing the blur to be updated when the regions in d are changed. We don't
	need to do that.
	
	NOTE: I couldn't find anything in nux that works similarly to X11's regions
	so I just used it directly. That can be removed if something else from
	nux is suitable.
	
	NOTE2: It seems like the damage regions nux is giving us for our BaseWindows
	are HUGE, this needs to be fixed in nux.

	Essential Nux event signals have been renamed. To ease the transition, the former name have been preserved via macros:
	
	#define OnMouseMove             mouse_move
	#define OnMouseDown             mouse_down
	#define OnMouseUp                 mouse_up
	#define OnMouseEnter            mouse_enter
	#define OnMouseLeave            mouse_leave
	#define OnMouseClick            mouse_click
	#define OnMouseDoubleClick      mouse_double_click
	#define OnMouseDrag             mouse_drag
	#define OnMouseWheel            mouse_wheel
	#define OnMouseDownOutsideArea  mouse_down_outside_pointer_grab_area
	#define OnKeyEvent              key_down
	#define OnKeyReleased           key_up
	#define OnStartKeyboardReceiver begin_key_focus
	#define OnStopKeyboardReceiver  end_key_focus
	
	This branch is using the new signals names. Subsequently, the old signals will be removed in Nux.

	merge launcher edge reveal branch

2011-07-28  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	Added configurable option to define the launcher edge-show timeout
	
	A compiz option has been added to define the timeout to wait before
	showing the launcher when the left edge has been touched.
	
	Default value set to 150 ms.

2011-07-28  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	Edge launcher reveal: reduce the timeout and reduce unwanted revelations
	
	Reduce the timeout before revealing the launcher, but doesn't reveal it
	if after the timeout the mouse pointer is too far from the first hit point.
	If the launcher isn't shown due to a moviment in the Y axis, we'll try to
	show it until the mouse is touching the left edge.

	method is called. The real click position is exported as requested

	emitted only if the user middle-click and release over an indicator.
	(so the mouse click can be canceled releasing the mouse click
	outside the indicator entry space).

	(using the cairo group trick) and finally draw over a mask

	This should work fine with GTK theming and Cimi likes it ;)

	Some clean up + comments

2011-07-09  Neil Jagdish Patel  <neil.patel@canonical.com>

	Forgot to add support for sending the emitting GObject!
	This had the awesome effect of cleaning up a bunch of the code and basically things fell into place nicely after that.
	
	The only downside is we needed to drop Signal7 as Signal6 now reaches the sigc::slot limit of 8 types (we can easily make Signal7 if we need to in the future, i just went through Devhelp and couldn't find something that send out 7 args!).
	
	With it working and the tests passing, I've ported over DBusIndicators to use glib::SignalManager, which seems to work fine.

	This branch has been adapted to the new event system in Nux.
	
	All the member functions ::ProcessEvent are now obsolete. However you should see that the changes to Unity are not that big.
	Here is what to expect with this branch:
	- Keyboard navigation in the dash is functional, minus a few glitches to resolve.
	- Alt+F1 is working in the launcher. Key navigation in and out of the quicklist is also working.
	
	Please report all the regressions you see.

	Don't ack double/triple click or super press on bfb and places icons.
	(LP: #766776)
	This is workarounded in different files right now, the correct fix will be to
	handle that in the ubus level (too risky at this stage), added FIXME to remember
	that for oneiric.
	
	There is one glitch though, which cannot been tackled without the ubus rewrite:
	- if you open a place, then, double click on a placeicon in the launcher to
	close it, it will be closed by will be reactivated (this is because we send
	the UBUS_PLACE_ENTRY_ACTIVATE_REQUEST again on click).
	- so, the next super press will not show the home dash, but the active place
	(closing/opening it again will reset to the home dash)
	
	I still think it's an improvment (see Charline's report in maverick for double
	clicking on bfb and people being puzzled) and the last described glitch only
	impact people double clicking on a place LauncherIcon for closing it…

	Add support for launcher/quicklist keyboard-navigation to also react on cursor-keys of numeric keypad. Fixes LP: #741154
	
	Since it is not clear, if adding the needed defines for the num. keypad cursor-keys to nux breaks ABI, I've added them locally to Launcher.cpp and QuicklistView.cpp as a temp. workaround.

2011-03-31  Jay Taoko  <jay.taoko@canonical.com>

	On Behalf of: Alejandro Piñeiro
	
	This branch provides the base support for the Dash.
	
	Some explanation:
	* Dash is using Focusable class to manage the focus
	* But it is not used on the Launcher
	* So I needed to use both, and being care to not create
	* In the same way, places still requires the low level focus management, as the top level window (a base window) still requires to get the key input focus
	* But the places focus management based on Focusable can start to be applied before receive the key input focus.
	* So in order to have a proper order (base window focus, then places contain focus), I don't emit the focus change based on Focusable until the top level base window became active.
	
	So, with this branch:
	* Launcher is still working
	* Pressing Alt+F2 you get the notification of places window being focused, and search bar entry being focused.
	
	NOTE: with the alt+f2 thing, we get a extra notification or orca. I will try to fix it while Rodrigo reviews the branch

	Merge Dylan's work after resolving a merge confict! Thanks a lot/
	
	This branch changes the mechanics for the top panel acting as a titlebar.
	Previously, the top panel could be dragged in order to unmaximize (and move) a
	maximized window, but only if that window was in focus. This opened up some
	issues, which are covered in bug #716177.
	
	With this branch, Unity's PanelMenuView maintains a list of maximized windows.
	(Note: When I say “maximized window,” I really mean “a window that Unity has
	started decorating instead of the window decorator.” Right now, that is limited
	to maximized windows).
	
	When the user clicks the top panel, that click affects the front-most of the
	PanelMenuView's maximized windows. Previously, OnMaximizedGrab would only affect
	the active window if it was maximized.
	I also added some code to Activate the front-most maximized window, bringing it
	into focus when the top panel is clicked.
	
	There is some intricacy involving multiple viewports and desktops, where the top
	panel should never act as a titlebar for a window that is not visible (be it
	behind another maximized window or on a different viewport). I believe I have
	covered the appropriate cases in WindowManager::IsWindowOnCurrentDesktop and
	WindowManager::IsWindowObscured.
	
	Fix:
	
	Bug #716177: The Unity Panel's window controls and window dragging features
	should work for the uppermost maximized window regardless of current window in
	focus
	Bug #723882: When a maximized window has window on top of it in 'restored state'
	(not maximised) , it is not possible to un-maximized the window by dragging the
	title bar downwards
	Bug #736580: Possible race condition in PanelMenuView::OnWindowMaximized and
	OnWindowRestored

2011-03-17  Dylan McCall  <dylanmccall@gmail.com>

	Continue to decorate or undecorate umaximized or maximized windows regardless of current focus. Fixes race condition. (LP: #736580)
	Removed obsolete FIXME.

2011-03-15  Dylan McCall  <dylanmccall@gmail.com>

	Strengthened code for determining front-most maximized window.
	Split WindowManager::IsWindowVisible to IsWindowOnCurrentDesktop and IsWindowObscured.
	Added PanelMenuView::GetMaximizedWindow, which returns the (maximized) window attached to the top panel.
	Updated OnMouseMiddleClicked.
	Removed debug messages.

2011-03-15  Dylan McCall  <dylanmccall@gmail.com>

	Attach 'monitor-changed' and 'size-changed' signals the right way 'round.
	
	We were unintentionally calling UnityScreen::NeedsRelayout() on a GdkScreen in
	these signal handlers.  That's not going to end well.

	Bug #725529: Double-click on panel to unmaximize only works in right half
	Contributed by Oliver Sauder
	
	The mouse events from the Nux InputArea seem to be a bit "bumpy" (also mentioned
	in some FIXME in the unity code).
	
	The OnMouseClick is only emitted when _event_processor.MouseIn() is true, which
	does not apply when clicking on the left side of the title bar.
	
	Therefore, as a workaround I've replaced the OnMouseClick event with OnMouseUp
	to implement the double click behavior. In the long run I suppose it would be
	desirable to fix the mouse events in Nux.

	monitor too, but changes nothing).
	
	This ensures the panel and launcher remain entirely visible when multiple

	items completely unreachable (like the garbage bin).

	Try to get a better animation when hovering the launcher (LP: #721125)
	Basically, the fade animation goes from 25% of opacity to 75%. The slide goes
	from 0% to 45%
	Then, when we are "locking" it, the position based animation goes to a time
	based one to not make the final animation too bumpy (there is only 4/5 frames
	for few ms in the fade animation, but it's just better that just pushing to
	100% of opacity).
	This enabled to clean a little bit the logic as well.
	There is also a dead locking zone of 2x2

	fix a corner case issue triggering the lock

2011-02-16  Didier Roche  <didier.roche@canonical.com>

	This branch intends to:
	- clean a lot the autohide logic. Removing action_done and introducing just one
	state: the launcher is locked on mouseover or not
	- add the fading effect as in the spec. The initial fade is at ~ 33% instead of
	50% which made blinging. The fade only appears when hovering the trigger. The
	lock state is right now 0x0. We should maybe be a little bit more flexible in
	the future about the "locking value" (LP: #706146).
	- clicking on a launcher item still give the 1 second grace period before hiding
	the launcher. However, if you quit the launcher, the hiding animation is
	performed immediately.
	- removing a incorrect data type warning as well that was annoying me since last
	week :)

	Fading title: consider padding for long titles, don't fade the title too early
	
	The title should be faded just few pixel (currently I've
	increased the fading space to 30) before the end of the
	Panel Menuview (so before the indicators).
	The previous implementation was wrong, also due to the fact
	that for title slightly longer than the panel space no
	cut was applied.

	Plugin Adapter Focussed window is not needed, using Compiz activeWindow()
	
	Compiz already knows which is the focussed / active window, using
	it instead of my PluginAdapter implementation!

2011-02-09  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	Improved the Always and When Need Hide modes
	
	Don't perform unneeded iterations when the launcher shoudld be
	always hidden, just hide it.
	
	When the hide mode is on on "When Needed", don't consider invalid
	focussed windows as the ones that could make it show again.

2011-02-08  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	Support for multiple tipes of Hidding modes
	
	Now the bar can be:
	- Always shown
	- Always hidden (use the keyboard shortcut or mouse to show)
	- Automatically (when no window is below it)
	- When Needed (When no focussed window is below it: intellihide)
	
	Plus the AutoHide* functions are now called Hide functions...

2011-02-08  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	Better Autohide option, using the LauncherAutohideMode enum.

2011-02-08  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	Add IntelliHide as an option, to select when enabling AutoHide with intellihide or less
	
	This allows to set the Autohide option to:
	- Never (never autohide)
	- Always (always autohide the bar when there's a window below it)
	- When needed (autohide the bar only if the focussed window is below it)

2011-02-08  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	Enabling double click on the launcher to restore a maximized window
	(LP: #661049)
	
	This isn't the best fix as nux seems to have some broken piece in
	OnMouseDoubleClick but rather a temporary solution. Fixing it in nux will enable
	us to depend on system setup and such. For now, the faked double-click time is
	500ms.

	corner even if we mess again with size.

	Merge initial unity atk implementation

2011-01-13  Alejandro Piñeiro  <apinheiro@igalia.com>

	Initial unity/nux atk module implementation
	
	This commit includes the skeleton implementation for most of the ATK objects,
	that provides the accessibility support for the related nux and unity objects.
	
	Those objects doesn't provide too much functionality, but with them you can
	obtain the tree object hierarchy of the Launcher from a AT tool. This objects
	will be used as a base to work on. The next step will be fill them with
	functionality.
	
	This commit provides:
	
	* ATK objects for the nux objects Object, Area, View, Layout and BaseWindow.
	
	* ATK objects for the unity objects Launcher and LauncherIcon
	
	* As we don't want to add the accessibility tips directly on Nux, it is
	provided a factory like method, that maintains the reference of each
	accessible object on a hash table.
	
	* This factory method is based on the Object systems provided by Nux.
	
	* For this reason we needed to add Launcher and LauncherIcon on this
	object system (anyway, this was likely a error)
	
	* For the moment the Launcher window is added manually to the root. In
	the short term this will be improved by a signal-callback system.
	
	* We also provide some basic functionality on some objects:
	* The container AtkObject methods on all the objects (to get the hierarchy)
	* Screen position on Area
	* ATK object for LauncherIcon expose the LauncherIcon tooltip as the
	accessible object name

	Clean up the code style in the UBus test cases a bit

2010-11-26  Mikkel Kamstrup Erlandsen  <mikkel.kamstrup@gmail.com>

	Fix leak of UBusDispatchInfo.id member. This is done by using guints as handles instead of gulongs and using the standard glib macros GPOINTER_TO_UINT and GUINT_TO_POINTER
	
	With the new way of using the interest handles we can use the g_direct_* hash functions instead of the custom gulong_* ones we had before
	
	Code style cleanups

2010-11-26  Mikkel Kamstrup Erlandsen  <mikkel.kamstrup@gmail.com>

	Use interned message names for keys in the message_interest_table. This allows us to switch hash functions from g_str_* to g_direct_*. As well as saving us some reallocations
	
	Lots of code style cleanups

2010-11-26  Mikkel Kamstrup Erlandsen  <mikkel.kamstrup@gmail.com>

	Use the slice allocator for UBusDispatchInfo structs
	
	Use message names interned with g_string_chunk_insert_const() for UBusDispatchInfo

2010-11-26  Mikkel Kamstrup Erlandsen  <mikkel.kamstrup@gmail.com>

	Use a GStringChunk to improve memory management of message names. Also allows us to compare message names with direct pointer comparison
	
	Use the slice allocator for allocating UBusMessageInfos
	
	Fix leak of message names from ubus_server_finalize()

2010-11-26  Mikkel Kamstrup Erlandsen  <mikkel.kamstrup@gmail.com>

	Add static modifiers to private functions to prevent them from being exported by the linker and messing up our ABI

2010-11-26  Mikkel Kamstrup Erlandsen  <mikkel.kamstrup@gmail.com>

	Fix memory leaks:
	
	* Not taking floating ref of message payload (but normal ref only)
	* Not freeing the message name when disposing of a UBusMessageInfo

2010-10-01  Mikkel Kamstrup Erlandsen  <mikkel.kamstrup@gmail.com>

	Merge Mikkel's branch lp:~unity-team/unity/plugging-leaks-with-a-nailgun:
	
	* Plug elusive, but big, leaks when exercising the places. Note that low end graphics hardware (like my i945) still has trouble keeping up with our aggresive allocations of new textures for the tiles. This triggers lots of garbage collections in the driver which causes noticiable lag in the UI. Fixing this will require more work.
	
	* Fix occasional slowdown of place rendering because of mem churn

2010-10-01  Mikkel Kamstrup Erlandsen  <mikkel.kamstrup@gmail.com>

	Dammit Mikkel! Remember to chain up the dispose() handler already!

2010-10-01  Mikkel Kamstrup Erlandsen  <mikkel.kamstrup@gmail.com>

	Implement a "disposed mode" for the default group renderer. After dispose() has been run it drops all requests to update it's state. This seems to catch a leak we had where result (especially from the files place) could arrive after the place view had been closed, causing Tile actors to be generated and leaked - or something...

2010-09-30  Mikkel Kamstrup Erlandsen  <mikkel.kamstrup@gmail.com>

	Be sure to chain up when overriding dispose()

2010-09-30  Mikkel Kamstrup Erlandsen  <mikkel.kamstrup@gmail.com>

	Clean up some of the ref counting logic, plugging an odd leak. Also free all texture memory once a place is dismissed, we used to keep the textures around until next time we brought that particular place up again. This could cause problems on low end graphics hardware because the texture mem would be filled up causing all WM operations to be very slow.
	
	* Don't use manual unref() because of odd refcounts, but clean up the underlying code to return the right thing
	
	* Free all memory when a place is dismissed
	
	* Use Gee to manage lists of GObjects instead of G*List which have unclear memory semantics
	
	* There are still leaks. Sorry :´-|
	

2010-09-29  Mikkel Kamstrup Erlandsen  <mikkel.kamstrup@gmail.com>

	NOTE: ABI and API break in libunity was required to fix a leak. The affected abi+api was not used any where outside libunity itself.
	
	Revamp the internal re-usage of tiles to use Gee collections instead of GSList which doesn't work super well wth Vala mem management
	
	Discovered a bug in Vala causing it to generate self-refs in object constructors if the object has a delegate member which is set to a lambda or a non-static method on 'this'. This was the root cause of a series of leaks we have been battling for some time. Made the offending places use static methods in stead.

2010-09-22  Mikkel Kamstrup Erlandsen  <mikkel.kamstrup@gmail.com>

	Merge Mikkel's branch lp:~unity-team/unity/fast-icons:
	
	* This branch optimizes the icon loading considerably. Most notably the places will now appear on screen much faster. You will note that on initial launch of a place the icons will not appear instantly - in fact may appear to arrive slower than before. This is due to the fact that the new code shows the place on screen much earlier than the old code.
	
	* Fixes the bug where tiles in the places could sometimes have the wrong icon.
	
	* DISCLAIMER: It breaks ABI and API of Unity.IO. Slightly. This was required to remove a heckuwa lot of reallocations of some big IO buffers. Unity internally has been updated to reflect this (of course). The place daemons are the only other consumers, and I will update them to require the latest unity, which should make this a non-problem.

	API/ABI break of libunity: in unity_io_read_stream_async() only consumer is unity internally and the place daemons. They will be bumped to require the new libunity version. So no reason to change soname.
	
	Fixes bug where the wrong icon where at times associated with a tile in the places view. LP bug #642935
	
	Work on optimizing file icon loading:
	
	* Reduced number of reallocations
	* Increased buffer size and made sure the buffer is allocated only once
	* Less roundtrips to mainloop
	* Try and match read buffer size to default inode size (4k)
	* Sequential reading of queued files. Before this we'd load at minimum 10 in parallel! Note that this change might actually make the loading *slower* on SSD while almost certainly faster on conventional drives

	Merge Mikkel's branch lp:~unity-team/unity/updated-activation-api
	
	* The URI activation of place daemons can now determine whether the dash should be hidden or not after activation. This fixes the bug where we didn't hide the dash when the user clicks an item in the Available section of the apps place to bring up software-center. (Note that otoh we don't want to hide the dash when the user is doing folder browsing in the files place)

2010-08-25  Mikkel Kamstrup Erlandsen  <mikkel.kamstrup@gmail.com>

	Fix LP bug #612537 'Dash doesn't hide when clicking an app in the "Available" group'
	
	This is done through a slight refactoring moving all the launching logic into Unity.Places.Place and simply having Unity.Places.View react to that. Before this the launching logic was a bit split between these two classes.
	
	Note that this update is necessary to also reflect the new dbus wire format for com.canonical.Unity.Activation.Activate(uri)

	Merged my unity.more-visual-quicklist-tweaks branch after review and

	checkmark- and radiobutton-items in quicklists. It also indents all
	items (normal, image, checkmark, radio-button). Due to this and the
	fact that quicklists are meant to grow out of tooltips, the label of
	a tooltip is now also indented (balanced with a gap on the right side
	too... this was done after consulting Design).

2010-08-18  Mirco Müller  <mirco.mueller@ubuntu.com>

	After consultation with Otto about the issue with the item-indentation between tooltips and quicklists - in regards to the expand-animation - I added a larger margin on the right side for tooltips too so they look a bit more balanced. This is an intermediate solution until we have something better from design.

	Merged unity.fix-599718-resolved into trunk after review and approval
	from Gordon. This is an extended "resolve merge conflicts" of the
	initial unity.fix-599718 branch, which didn't cleanly merge as trunk
	changed under its feet. The main goal was to get rid of as many 
	queue-relayout and queue-redraw warnings for the quicklists as possible.
	Some still remain though. Furthermore object-generation was moved
	outside of allocation-call and separated out into a timeout-handler as
	was suggested.

2010-06-30  Mirco Müller  <mirco.mueller@ubuntu.com>

	modified:
	unity-private/launcher/quicklist-view.vala
	unity/quicklist-rendering.vala
	
	Merged branch unity.new-quicklist-rendering into trunk after review and
	approval from Gordon.
	
	Added the new texture-parts rendering for the quicklist/tooltip background,
	to go along with the new CtkMenuExpandable and related chagnes. The old 
	rendering calls are not deleted yet intentionally, because they are still
	used. Those will be removed once CtkMenuExpndable landed in clutk trunk.
	
	The new approach, to facilitate the reveal-animation in an efficient way,
	is to render the quicklist/tooltip background in three "layers" with
	split-up masks/parts: blurred with 3-5 masks applied, tint-dot-highlight
	with 3-5 masks applied, 3-5 texture-parts holding the drop-shadow and
	outline. The different masks/parts:
	
	* top
	* first optional dynamic part which can grow (using texture-repeating)
	* anchor
	* second optional dynamic part which can grow (using texture-repeating)
	* bottom

2010-06-30  Mirco Müller  <mirco.mueller@ubuntu.com>

	added new texture-parts rendering for the quicklist/tooltip background, old calls not been deleted intentionally, that removal will come with hooking these new calls up to CtkMenuExpandable, added temp. image-dumps in constructor for verification of rendering

2010-06-30  Mikkel Kamstrup Erlandsen  <kamstrup@hardback>

	Merge lp:~unity-team/unity/browsing-api which brings in the needed API updates to make folder browsing possible.
	
	WARNING: This gives a slight API break in the Unity.Place namespace of libunity.

2010-06-30  Mikkel Kamstrup Erlandsen  <kamstrup@hardback>

	Fix invocation of DBus SetSearch() to not expect a return value (updated DBus API for places)

2010-06-29  Mikkel Kamstrup Erlandsen  <kamstrup@hardback>

	Initial shot at wiring up the different DBus signals for the Unity.Place API to the Unity.Place.EntryInfo object's properties

2010-06-29  Mikkel Kamstrup Erlandsen  <kamstrup@hardback>

	Initial showel full of infrastructure needed to get the navigation and breadcrumbing working. Still incomplete
	
	API BREAK: This slighty breaks the API in the Unity.Place namespace:
	
	* EntryInfo is no longer abstract and no longer has the methods set_search() and set_global_search() instead it has two properties active_search and active_global_search which contains a Unity.Place.Search instance representing the active search
	
	* Renamed DBus signal renderer_info_changed to entry_renderer_info_changed and added a corresponding global_*
	
	* Add DBus method place_entry_info_changed

2010-06-29  Mikkel Kamstrup Erlandsen  <kamstrup@hardback>

	Merge lp:~unity-team/unity/async-io. This adds some new convenience API for dealing with (Desktop)AppInfos and doing async IO.
	
	* New namespace Unity.IO with functions to asynchronously read a file into a memory buffer, as well as asynchrnously looking for files in a set of given directories
	
	* New singleton Unity.AppInfoManager that can look up and cache AppInfos both synchronously and asynchronously

2010-06-29  Mikkel Kamstrup Erlandsen  <kamstrup@hardback>

	Expand tests for AppInfoManager to full API coverage

2010-06-29  Mikkel Kamstrup Erlandsen  <kamstrup@hardback>

	Sync with trunk.
	
	Add some tests for AppInfoManager

2010-06-28  Mikkel Kamstrup Erlandsen  <kamstrup@hardback>

	Async AppInfo loading and caching working and tested. I hooked up the Unity.Places.Tile class to use the new mechanism. No visible speedups though, major bottleneck is prolly icon loading.

2010-06-25  Mikkel Kamstrup Erlandsen  <kamstrup@hardback>

	Add utility functions in Unity.IO for async loading of files.
	
	Add a caching AppInfoManager that can load .desktop files async

	Merge lp:~unity-team/unity/entry-info-search-api-hack: WARNING API BREAK in libunity.
	
	Because Vala doesn't support async delegates we need to make the searching hooks be abstract async methods on the EntryInfo

2010-06-16  Mikkel Kamstrup Erlandsen  <kamstrup@hardback>

	WARNING: This commit makes Unity require a valac with this patch: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=621692. Makes EntryInfo an abstract class you must derive and override the set_search() and set_global_search() functions. Previously it used properties with delegates to avoid the subclassing, but that did not work out with Vala since Vala (currently) doesn't have async delegates. The upstream request for async delegates is https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=604827

	- Gee.HashMap is unable to be sorted, which was an oversight on my behalf when
	designing the API for the models. Hence I've made the 'get_indicator_list'
	return an ordered list of Indicator.Object's and added a get_indicator_name
	for the instances when the view needs to knoew the name of the object
	(which I may add to libindicator itself sometime soon)
	
	- With the new API, I added support for ordering the list
	
	- Updated existing code to use new API and did some clean up of debug messages

2010-03-30  Mirco Müller  <mirco.mueller@ubuntu.com>

	After a lot of ping-pong-ing screenshots with Design (Otto, Michael) of
	different settings being applied to background, blur, highlight/sheen and
	position, the Quicklists are now as Design wants them to look.
	Fixes LP: #550961.

2010-03-29  Mirco Müller  <mirco.mueller@ubuntu.com>

	Use an opacity of 50% for the background tint of the Quicklist. This
	improves the contrast of the white text of Quicklist-entries (and
	Tooltips) against any potential bright areas behind the Quicklist/Tooltip.
	Fixes LP: #550961.
