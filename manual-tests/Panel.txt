Panel Opacity Toggle
--------------------
This test shows how works the panel_opacity_maximized_toggle unity option

#. Open CCSM
#. Go in the "Experimental" tab
#. Set the "Panel Opacity" setting to a value less than 1.0 (best is 0.0 for testing)
#. Enable the "Panel Opacity for Maximized Windows Toggle"
#. Close all your opened windows
#. The panel should be transparent according to the opacity setting
#. Now open a window and make sure it is restored
#. Open another Window and make it maximized

Outcome
  When there's at least one maximized window on the current screen, the panel
  should become opaque, also if the opacity setting is set to 0.0. 
  Once all the maximized windows are closed, restored or not visible,
  the panel should go back to its defined opacity.


Panel Menus Revelation
----------------------
This test shows how the menus should be revealed when a new application has been
launched.

#. Start with a clear screen
#. Open a new application that has menus (i.e. gnome-terminal)

Outcome
  The panel should show the menus in global menu bar for two seconds.
  If a new gnome-terminal window is opened, the menus are not shown again.
  If more than one application is open at once, the menus of each application
  are shown once is focused.


Panel Double Clicks
-------------------
This test shows how the double click over the top panel should work.

#. Start with a clear screen
#. Open a window and maximize it
#. Double-click on the top-panel grab area (the empty area between the menus and
   the indicators).

Outcome
  The maximized window should restore. If no maximized window is available on
  the current workspace, nothing should happen.
