Panel Opacity Toggle
--------------------
This test shows how works the panel_opacity_maximized_toggle unity option

#. Open CCSM
#. Go in the "Experimental" tab
#. Set the "Panel Opacity" setting to a value less than 1.0 (best is 0.0 for testing)
#. Enable the "Panel Opacity for Maximized Windows Toggle"
#. Close all your opened windows
#. The panel should be transparent according to the opacity setting
#. Now open a window and make sure it is restored
#. Open another Window and make it maximized

Outcome
  When there's at least one maximized window on the current screen, the panel
  should become opaque, also if the opacity setting is set to 0.0. 
  Once all the maximized windows are closed, restored or not visible,
  the panel should go back to its defined opacity.
