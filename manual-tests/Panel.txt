Panel Opacity Toggle
--------------------
This test shows how works the panel_opacity_maximized_toggle unity option

Setup:

Actions:
#. Open CCSM
#. Go in the "Experimental" tab
#. Set the "Panel Opacity" setting to a value less than 1.0 (best is 0.0 for testing)
#. Enable the "Panel Opacity for Maximized Windows Toggle"
#. Close all your opened windows
#. The panel should be transparent according to the opacity setting
#. Now open a window and make sure it is restored
#. Open another Window and make it maximized

Expected Result:
  When there's at least one maximized window on the current screen, the panel
  should become opaque, also if the opacity setting is set to 0.0. 
  Once all the maximized windows are closed, restored or not visible,
  the panel should go back to its defined opacity.

Menu Color
----------
This test shows the color of the menus using the Ambiance theme:

Setup:

Actions:
#. Start with a clean screen
#. Open an application window with menus
#. Go on the top panel and open a menu

Expected Result:
  The menu should have a black background (i.e. #403f3a)

Middle-clicking or Scrolling over active Indicators
---------------------------------------------------
This test shows how the indicators icons should react to events when active.

Setup:

Actions:
#. Start on a clean screen
#. Open an indicator Menu (i.e. indicator-sound, not a global menu item)
#. Move the mouse pointer over the indicator-sound and middle-click or scroll
   over it.

Expected Result:
  The indicator-sound should mute/unmute on middle-clicks, and change the system
  volume on scroll.
  Middle-clicking over global-menu items should work as before (causing the open
  indicator menu to close).

Panel appearance with overlays
------------------------------
Setup:
Actions:
  * Press <super> to bring up the dash
  * Assert: The panel should be translucent matching the dash background
  * Press <alt> to bring up the hud without closing the dash
  * Assert: The panel should stay translucent

Expected Result:
 All assertions from above hold.


Disabled Top-level Menus
------------------------
Setup:
#. Install the 'gnome-dictionary' package.

Actions:
#. Launch the 'gnome-dictionary' application.
#. Open the 'View' menu.
#. Move the mouse over the 'Go' menu.

#. Optionally: Run emacs23
#. Optionally: Open a large file in emacs23.
#. Optionally: Scroll to the bottom of the file using Page Down.

Expected Result:
  At no point during the actions should the panel (or launcher) blink or
  flicker out of existence.


Panel shadow overdraw
---------------------
Setup:
#. Install Google Chrome or Chromium.

Actions:
#. Maximize a Chrome window.
#. Open several tabs so that the titles of some tabs are not fully visible
   and fade out to the right.
#. Hover the mouse over the very top part of some tabs so tooltips appear.

Expected Result:
  No part of the panel shadow should ever appear on top of the maximized
  Chrome window.


Panel shadow fullscreen
-----------------------
Setup:
#. Install Google Chrome or Chromium.

Actions:
#. Open Chrome and go full screen (F11)
