Panel Opacity Toggle
--------------------
This test shows how works the panel_opacity_maximized_toggle unity option

#. Open CCSM
#. Go in the "Experimental" tab
#. Set the "Panel Opacity" setting to a value less than 1.0 (best is 0.0 for testing)
#. Enable the "Panel Opacity for Maximized Windows Toggle"
#. Close all your opened windows
#. The panel should be transparent according to the opacity setting
#. Now open a window and make sure it is restored
#. Open another Window and make it maximized

Outcome
  When there's at least one maximized window on the current screen, the panel
  should become opaque, also if the opacity setting is set to 0.0. 
  Once all the maximized windows are closed, restored or not visible,
  the panel should go back to its defined opacity.


Panel Menus Revelation
----------------------
This test shows how the menus should be revealed when a new application has been
launched.

#. Start with a clear screen
#. Open a new application that has menus (i.e. gnome-terminal)

Outcome
  The panel should show the menus in global menu bar for two seconds.
  If a new gnome-terminal window is opened, the menus are not shown again.
  If more than one application is open at once, the menus of each application
  are shown once is focused.


Panel Double Clicks
-------------------
This test shows how the double click over the top panel should work.

#. Start with a clear screen
#. Open a window and maximize it
#. Double-click on the top-panel grab area (the empty area between the menus and
   the indicators).

Outcome
  The maximized window should restore. If no maximized window is available on
  the current workspace, nothing should happen.

Menu Color
----------
This test shows the color of the menus using the Ambiance theme:

#. Start with a clean screen
#. Open an application window with menus
#. Go on the top panel and open a menu

Outcome:
  The menu should have a black background (i.e. #403f3a)

Middle-clicking or Scrolling over active Indicators
---------------------------------------------------
This test shows how the indicators icons should react to events when active.

#. Start on a clean screen
#. Open an indicator Menu (i.e. indicator-sound, not a global menu item)
#. Move the mouse pointer over the indicator-sound and middle-click or scroll
   over it.

Outcome
  The indicator-sound should mute/unmute on middle-clicks, and change the system
  volume on scroll.
  Middle-clicking over global-menu items should work as before (causing the open
  indicator menu to close).

Menus and Active Indicators
---------------------------
This test shows the interaction between the global menu and open indicators.

#. Start on a clean screen
#. Open an application that has menus (i.e a gnome-terminal)
#. Open an indicator Menu (i.e. indicator sound)
#. Move the mouse pointer on the PanelMenuGrabArea (i.e the area between the
   indicators and the global menu)

Outcome
  The menu should appear. This was happening only when going over the menus,
  not over the empty panel area.


Window Buttons and Active Indicators
------------------------------------
This test shows the interaction between the window buttons and open indicators.

#. Start on a clean screen
#. Open an application that has menus (i.e a gnome-terminal)
#. Maximize it
#. Open an indicator Menu (i.e. indicator sound)
#. Move the mouse pointer on the top-left corner of the screen

Outcome
