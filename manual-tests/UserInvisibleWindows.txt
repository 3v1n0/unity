Running Application with both visible and invisible windows
-----------------------------------------------------------
This test shows how unity should manage applications with both user visible
and invisible windows.

#. Start on a clean screen
#. Open one or more windows of an application with the skip-taskbar flag set to OFF
#. Open one or more windows of that application with the skip-taskbar flag set to ON

Outcome
  The launcher icon should count with left icon indicators (pips) only the visible
  window(s); when clicking on it or selecting it via Alt+Tab unity should bring
  to focus only the visible windows, while at the second click over the launcher
  the spread with both visible and invisible windows should be activated.
  When all the user-visible windows are closed, the application should stay in
  the launcher or in the Alt+Tab (and show as running) only if is sticky,
  otherwise the icon should hide.
