#Please use this template for adding new manual-tests to ensure a consistency.
#Text to be changed is enclosed in <<>>
#
#Please also note that Tests should test ONE THING ONLY. If you want to test
#more than one thing, write multiple tests. That helps us to automate them as
#well as execute them manually.

#If you're testing purely visual changes, please make sure you link to a
#reference image or add it to the bzr repository.
