Running Application with both visible and invisible windows
-----------------------------------------------------------
This test shows how unity should manage applications with both user visible
and invisible windows.

Setup:

Actions:
  * Open gedit
  * Open the 'open files' dialog
  * Assert: The launcher icon should count with left icon indicators (pips) only 
    the visible  window(s); 
  * Click the gedit launcher icon
  * Assert: The main gedit window should come into focus
  * Click the gedit launcher icon again, gedit still focused
  * Assert: Spread with both visible and invisible windows should be activated.

Expected Result:
  Assertions from above hold.

Auto-maximize window -- window not maximized
----------------------
Thit test make sure that the auto-maximize window feature is disabled for
resolution above the 1024x600.

Setup:
#. Open the display panel
#. Set a resolution greater then 1024x600 (e.g 1366x768)

Actions:
#. Open nautilus

Expected Result:
  The window should not be in the maximized state.


Auto-maximize window -- window auto-maximized
----------------------
Setup:
#. Open the display panel
#. Set a resolution lower or equal to 1024x600.
#. Open the ccsm and change the automaximize-threshold option to 20 (experimental-tab of unity-plugin).

Actions:
#. Open nautilus, that usually doesn't start maximized

Expected Result:
  The window should be in the maximized state.


Fullscreen windows

Tests rendering of fullscreen windows.

Setup:

Action:
#. Set a window to full screen. e.g. F11 in a web browser.
#. Verify you can scroll the window.
#. Tap the Super key.
#. Verify you can still scroll the window.

Expected Result:
  The fullscreen window should never look corrupt and always be scrollable.
 
Recovery (in case of failure):
#. Tap the Super key again.
#. Tap F11 to leave full screen.
#. Press Super+S twice to force a full screen redraw.


Show Desktop fades windows smoothly
