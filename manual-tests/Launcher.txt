Note, for simplification, one pip is defined as a single filled in arrow to the 
      left of a launcher.

Test Launcher Icon with Windows in multiple workspaces
------------------------------------------------------
This test shows how the launcher should draw when there are application windows
in multiple workspaces.

#. Start on a fresh login
#. Run an application
#. Run another instance (window) of this application and keep it on the initial workspace
#. Run another instance (window) of this application and move it to another workspace
#. Go back to the initial workspace

Outcome
  The Launcher icon "pips" (indicators) should reflect the number of windows in the
  current workspace, so when showing the "initial" workspace the launcher icon should
  have 2 "pips", when moving to the second workspace (where there's only 1 window)
  the launcher application icon should have a left filled arrow.
  When moving to a workspace where there are no windows, the launcher icon should
  use an empty (non filled) arrow as left indicator (despite the number of opened windows).


Test Launcher Spread with Windows in multiple workspaces
--------------------------------------------------------
This test shows how the launcher should spread the windows when they are in
multiple workspaces.

#. Start on a fresh login
#. Run an application
#. Run another instance of this application and keep it on the initial workspace
#. Run another instance of this application and move it no another workspaces
#. Go back to the initial workspace and focus the application windows

Outcome
  When in the current workspace there are multiple windows of the same
  application and one of them is focused, clicking on the launcher should spread
  only the windows that are in the current workspace.
  If in the current workspace there is just one window, clicking on the launcher
  icon should only focus it and nothing else (also with multiple clicks).
  When moving to a workspace where there are no window o the given application,
  clicking on its launcher icon should bring to focus the last focused window
  in the last used workspace.

Test Alt+F1 KeyNavMode Mouse Works
-------------------------------
This test shows that the mouse still works normally while keynav mode is active.

#. Press Alt+F1 to enter keynav mode
#. Using the mouse perform a normal action (such as dragging a window)

Outcome
  The keynav mode exits, along with the mouse performing the normal action 
  the user expects. Such as highlighting text, moving a window, clicking out
  of keynav mode, or clicking on a launcher icon. All these actions should 
  also exit the keynav mode.

Test Alt+F1 KeyNavMode Shortcuts
-----------------------------
This test shows that all the shortcuts work and also exits from keynav mode.

#. Press Alt+F1 to enter keynav mode
#. Press Super + a 
#. Press Esc
#. Press Alt+F1
#. Press Alt + Tab
#. Press Alt+F1
#. Press Ctrl + Alt + t

Outcome
  The first shortcut opens the dash app lens, which it should open it and quit the
  nav mode. The second shortcut switches between applications. The last one will open
  a new terminal. This is to show all SUPER, ALT, and CTRL shortcuts work; while
  closing the keynav mode.

Test Alt+F1 NavMode Quicklist Click Exit 
----------------------------------------
This Test shows that clicking on a quicklist option quits keynav mode.

#. Press Alt+F1 to enter keynav mode
#. Press Right arrow
#. Click on any option

Outcome
  No matter what option you click will exit keynav mode.

Drag Icons to Trash
-------------------

This test verifies that dragging icons to the trash removes them from the 
launcher, and that the animation is smooth.

#. Move mouse pointer over an application icon (not BFB, Workspace switcher, trash, or device icon)
#. Hold mouse button down until icon attached to moue pointer (1 Second or so)
#. With the mouse button held down, drag the icon over the trash icon.
#. Release the mouse pointer.

Outcome:
  * The icon should be removed from the launcher.
  * The trash can icon should remain stationary during the entire operation.
  * The operation should NOT LOOK LIKE THIS: https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/932365/+attachment/2739868/+files/out-2.ogv
