Test Launcher Icon with Windows in multiple workspaces
------------------------------------------------------
This test shows how the launcher should draw when there are application windows
in multiple workspaces.

#. Start on a fresh login
#. Run an application
#. Run another instance of this application and keep it on the initial workspace
#. Run another instance of this application and move it no another workspaces
#. Go back to the initial workspace

Outcome
  The Launcher icon "pips" should reflect the number of windows in the current
  workspace, so when showing the "initial" workspace the launcher icon should
  have 2 "pips", when moving to the second workspace (where there's only 1 window)
  the launcher application icon should show 1 pip.
  When moving to a workpace where there are no windows, the launcher icon shuould
  use an empty arrow as left indicator.
