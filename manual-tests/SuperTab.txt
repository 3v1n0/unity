---------------------------
This test shows how the Super+Tab launcher switcher works

#. Open some sticky applications
#. Press Super+Tab
#. Release and Press again Tab some times
#. Press also the Shift key and press again Tab
#. Release all the keys

Outcome:
  The first launcher item should be highlighted.
  Pressing Tab multiple times makes the next launcher icon to be highlighted.
  If clicking on the launcher while the Super+Tab switcher is active, the switcher
  should terminate and the standard click action should be done.

  icon.
  When releasing Super the highlighted launcher icon should be activated, and
  the default launcher icon action should be performed.
