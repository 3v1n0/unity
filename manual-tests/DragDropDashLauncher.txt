- open Dash
- go to Files-lens
- select and drag a document-file (e.g. text or image) to the launcher
- as you drag the document-file watch the drag-targets (drop-recepticals) saturate
- this saturation-process should be smooth and without flicker
- the tinting of the non-drag-targets should not change
