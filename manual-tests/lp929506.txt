Regression testcase for
https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/929506
----------------------------------------------------
Setup: restart your computer to get a clean unity instance

Steps to perform:
1. Login to your Unity-3D shell but don't start or do anything (e.g. don't
press the super key and/or show the dash)
2. Verify the lensees are not running using the following command:
$ ps axf|grep [u]nity-lens
Output of this command should be empty
3. invoke dash (e.g. by pressing the Super key)
4. Verify the lenses were started by using the following command:
$ ps axf|grep [u]nity-lens


Expected Outcome:
Step #2 should produce an empty output.
Step #4 should produce something like this:
$ ps axf|grep [u]nity-lens
 2754 ?        Sl     0:00 /usr/lib/unity-lens-applications/unity-applications-daemon
 2756 ?        Sl     0:00 /usr/lib/unity-lens-files/unity-files-daemon
 2758 ?        Sl     0:00 /usr/lib/unity-lens-music/unity-music-daemon
 2760 ?        Sl     0:00 /usr/bin/python /usr/lib/unity-lens-video/unity-lens-video
 2816 ?        Sl     0:00 /usr/lib/unity-lens-music/unity-musicstore-daemon


Wrong Outcome:
#2 and #4 both produce non-empty result which means the lenses were not
lazy-loaded but they were running before the first dash use.
