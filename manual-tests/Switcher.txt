Multi-monitor Alt-Tab
---------------------
This test only applies for multiple monitor.
App names here are an example, any apps will do.

Setup:
#. Start with no apps open (or at least remember what is open where)
#. Start terminal on workspace 1
#. Start firefox on workspace 2
#. Move to workspace 2

Scenario 1: Perform on workspace 1
Scenario 2: Perform on workspace 2

Action:
#. Hold Alt, press tab
#. Observe
#. Release Alt

Scenario 1 Outcome:
  Terminal is shown in the alt-tab switcher, but firefox on workspace 2 is not.
Scenario 2 Outcome:
  Firefox is shown in the alt-tab switcher, but the terminal on workspace 1 is not.


Panel on Alt+Tab
----------------
This tests that the panel title changes with Alt+Tab

Setup:
#. Open some new applications

Action:
#. Press Alt+Tab

Outcome
  When you press Alt+Tab to switch window, the application title in the top left
  of the panel should change inline with changes in alt-tab focus.
  Also the menus shouldn't ever show. Even if the mouse has been left over
  the panel when starting the Alt+Tab.


Quick Alt+Tab
-------------
This test shows how the alt+tab works when pressed quickly

#. Start on a clean screen
#. Open two windows of the same application (i.e. gnome-terminal)
#. Open another window of another application (i.e. gedit)
#. Focus a gnome-terminal window
#. Quickly press Alt+Tab
#. The gedit window should be now on focus
#. Press again Alt+Tab

Outcome
  The gnome-terminal window that had been in focus before should be brought to
  focus again. The second gnome-terminal window should below the gnome-terminal
  and gedit windows. The same should happen if the gnome-terminal windows are
  in different workspaces.
