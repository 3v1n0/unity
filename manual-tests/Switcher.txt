Multi-monitor Alt-Tab
---------------------
This test only applies for multiple monitor.
App names here are an example, any apps will do.

Setup:
#. Start with no apps open (or at least remember what is open where)
#. Start terminal on workspace 1
#. Start firefox on workspace 2
#. Move to workspace 2

Scenario 1: Perform on workspace 1
Scenario 2: Perform on workspace 2

Actions:
#. Hold Alt, press tab
#. Observe
#. Release Alt

Expected Result:
Scenario 1:
  Terminal is shown in the alt-tab switcher, but firefox on workspace 2 is not.
Scenario 2:
  Firefox is shown in the alt-tab switcher, but the terminal on workspace 1 is not.


Panel on Alt+Tab
----------------
This tests that the panel title changes with Alt+Tab

Setup:
#. Open some new applications

Actions:
#. Press Alt+Tab

Expected Result:
  When you press Alt+Tab to switch window, the application title in the top left
  of the panel should change inline with changes in alt-tab focus.
  Also the menus shouldn't ever show. Even if the mouse has been left over
  the panel when starting the Alt+Tab.

Full app title in Chinese
-------------------------
This test ensures that the App Switcher (Alt+Tab) displays the full title
of apps in Chinese.

Setup:
#. Install gnome-tweak-tool and run it.
#. Make sure you have the default font scaling factor (1.0).

Actions:
#. Run:
   python -c 'from gi.repository import Gtk;win=Gtk.Window(title="显示桌面");win.connect("destroy", Gtk.main_quit);win.show_all();Gtk.main();'
#. Press Alt+Tab.
#. Continue to press Tab to select the newly created window.

Expected Result:
  The title of the newly created window should be "显示桌面" and *not* "显示桌...".


Alt+keyabovetab switching
------------------------------
This test ensures that alt+keyabovetab switching windows of the application
works as it should.

Setup:
#. Have a few windows of one application open (e.g. 3 terminal windows).

Actions:
#. Focus one of the opened application windows.
#. Press Alt+keyabovetab (the ~ key on the US and PL keyboard).
#. Keep the Alt key pressed.

Expected Result:
  The switcher should appear with the detail view for the given application
  (e.g. the terminal), with all terminal applications for the workspace
  visible. The switcher should look normally.


Fast alt+keyabovetab switching
------------------------------
This test ensures that doing a fast tap does not result in any 'flickering' of
the switcher window. The switcher should not appear during a quick tap, just
during longer alt+keyabovetab presses.

Setup:
#. Have a few windows of one application open (e.g. 3 terminal windows)

Actions:
#. Focus one of the opened application windows.
#. Quickly tap Alt+keyabovetab (meaning only tap once, do not hold)
#. Repeat at least a few times

Expected Result:
  On every quick tap, the focus should switch to the next same-application
  type window. During that switch the switcher should not appear, not even
  for a brief moment (if done fast enough). No 'flickering' of the switcher.


Fast mouse-wheel switching
--------------------------
This test ensures that there is 'smoothing' when using the mouse-wheel to select
from the switcher.

Setup:
#. Have a couple of different applications open (i.e. a Terminal and a
 Mahjongg).

Actions:
  * Hold down the 'Alt' and tap 'Tab' key.
  * While holding down the 'Alt' key, scroll the middle mouse-wheel downward
    quickly 3-4 clicks.
  * Assert: The switcher should only select the next icon (and not zoom through the list).
  * Hold down the 'Alt' and tap 'Tab' key.
  * While holding down the 'Alt' key, scroll the middle mouse-wheel upward
    quickly 3-4 clicks.
  * Assert: The switcher should only select the next icon (and not zoom through the list).

Expected Result:
  The assertions from above hold.
