Menus and Active Indicators
---------------------------
This test shows the interaction between the global menu and open indicators.

#. Start on a clean screen
#. Open an application that has menus (i.e a gnome-terminal)
#. Open an indicator Menu (i.e. indicator sound)
#. Move the mouse pointer on the PanelMenuGrabArea (i.e the area between the
   indicators and the global menu)

Outcome
  The menu should appear. This was happening only when going over the menus,
  not over the empty panel area.
