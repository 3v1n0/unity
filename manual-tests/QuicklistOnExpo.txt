Test Quicklist while on Expo
============================

This test shows how the launcher quicklists work when the expo plugin is activated.

#. Start with a clear screen
#. Press Super+S or select the workspace switcher on the launcher
#. When the workspace switcher is running, right-click over a launcher icon

Outcome
  The expo should terminate, and the quicklist should be shown once the
  workspace switcher has been closed.
  Clicking over a quicklist item should work as expected and clicking outside
  that quicklist, should close it.
