Ubuntu Software Center Launcher Integration, installing an application from the Ubuntu archives
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Setup: 
#. Launch Ubuntu Software Center

Actions:  
#. In Software Center, navigate to the "Games" category and click on an uninstalled game in the list.
#. Click the "More Info" button.
#. In the details view for the game, click the "Install" button.
#. Enter the password for the install when prompted.

Expected Result:
  The game begins to install and the progress bar moves in Software Center.
  At the very *end* of the installation process (when the progress bar has completed), the icon for the game "flies" into the Unity Launcher.
  Verify that the icon that has been added to the launcher:
   - Has the correct icon for the game that was installed.
   - Hovering the mouse cursor over the icon displays the name of the application for its tooltip (and that it does *not* display the text "Waiting to install").
   - Clicking the icon launches the newly installed game.
