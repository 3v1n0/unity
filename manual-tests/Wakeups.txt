Launcher autoscroll wake-ups
----------------------------
This test makes sure that the timer controlling autoscroll animations does
not keep running (at 50Hz) when it's not required to animate anything. This
is LP: #917210.

#. Ensure the screen is idle, with very little changing.
#. Open a terminal and start a tool that can measure process wakeups per
   second. You can choose one of:
     - gnome-power-statistics (click on Processor)
     - powertop
     - eventstat
#. Hover the mouse pointer over the top end of the Launcher. That's just above
   the Ubuntu icon.
#. Hover the mouse pointer over the bottom end of the Launcher. That's over
   the bottom of the trash icon.
#. Move the mouse pointer back to the centre of the screen and leave it there.
#. Wait 30-60 seconds, leaving the screen idle before verifying the Outcome.

Outcome
  The number of wakeups per second (events per second) reported for the
  compiz process should be much lower than 50.
