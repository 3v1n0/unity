Preview Open Animation
----------------------
This tests the dash animation transition to the preview

Setup:
#. Open dash super
#. Open a lens which supports previewing (e.g. Application, Music, File)

Actions:
#. Right click on an icon in the dash

Expected Result:
  The central part of the dash split itself up just below the icon that was clicked, to reveal the preview window. It fades out but does not become fully transparent.
  The Search Entry slides up and fades out.
  If opened, the Filter Bar slides away to the right and fades.
  Above the Preview, there is a faded out row of icons that include the icon that was right clicked.


Preview Close Animation
-----------------------
This tests the preview close animation

Setup:
#. Open dash super
#. Open a lens which supports previewing (e.g. Application, Music, File)
#. Right-click the mouse on an icon to open its preview.
#. Wait for the preview window to open and finish animating.

Actions:
#. Press Escape.

Expected Result:
  The Preview is progressively scaled down and disapears.
  The search bar slides in from the top.
  If the Filter Bar was opened when the Preview started, it will slide in from the right 
  to its normal position.
  The splitted and faded out dash appears to close itself and regain it full opacity.
