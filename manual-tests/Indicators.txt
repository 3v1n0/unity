Middle-clicking or Scrolling over active Indicators
---------------------------------------------------
This test shows how the indicators icons should react to events when active.

#. Start on a clean screen
#. Open an indicator Menu (i.e. indicator-sound, not a global menu item)
#. Move the mouse pointer over the indicator-sound and middle-click or scroll
   over it.

Outcome
  The indicator-sound should mute/unmute on middle-clicks, and change the system
  volume on scroll.
  Middle-clicking over global-menu items should work as before (causing the open
  indicator menu to close).
