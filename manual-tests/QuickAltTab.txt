Quick Alt+Tab
-------------
This test shows how the alt+tab works when pressed quickly

#. Start on a clean screen
#. Open two windows of the same application (i.e. gnome-terminal)
#. Open another window of another application (i.e. gedit)
#. Focus a gnome-terminal window
#. Quickly press Alt+Tab
#. The gedit window should be now on focus
#. Press again Alt+Tab

Outcome
  The gnome-terminal window that had been in focus before should be brought to
  focus again. The second gnome-terminal window should below the gnome-terminal
  and gedit windows. The same should happen if the gnome-terminal windows are
  in different workspaces.
