Dash search
-----------
This test makes sure that the right command is run when you search
using the dash. (see lp:856205)

#. Press Alt+F2
#. Press 'g'. Make sure you see some command name (like gcc)
#. Quickly type 'edit<Enter>' - so you'd run 'gedit'.

Outcome
  The dash disappears, and gedit is run. If nothing happens or the first
  command is run (in this case gcc), this test failed.

Dash SearchBar middle-click
---------------------------
This test shows how the middle click over the dash search bar should work
(see lp:842462)

#. Open a text editor, and write some dummy text
#. Select some text part of the written dummy text with mouse
#. Press Super or Alt+F2 to open the Dash
#. Move the mouse over the dash search bar
#. Press middle click to paste the content of your primary clipboard

Outcome
  The text previously selected is pasted on the search bar at mouse pointer
  position, if the operation is repeated the text is inserted where
  the mouse pointer is.
