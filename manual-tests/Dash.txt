Dash search
-----------
This test makes sure that the right command is run when you search
using the dash. (see lp:856205)

#. Press Alt+F2
#. Press 'g'. Make sure you see some command name (like gcc)
#. Quickly type 'edit<Enter>' - so you'd run 'gedit'.

Outcome
  The dash disappears, and gedit is run. If nothing happens or the first
  command is run (in this case gcc), this test failed.
