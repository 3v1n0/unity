Dash search
-----------
This test makes sure that the right command is run when you search
using the dash. (see lp:856205)

#. Press Alt+F2
#. Press 'g'. Make sure you see some command name (like gcc)
#. Quickly type 'edit<Enter>' - so you'd run 'gedit'.

Outcome
  The dash disappears, and gedit is run. If nothing happens or the first
  command is run (in this case gcc), this test failed.
  

Category headers focus
----------------------
This test makes sure that clicking on a category headers doesn't focus it.

#. Open the apps lens.
#. Click on the dash search bar to make sure that the search bar has the focus.
#. Click on a category header to expand/collapse a category

Outcome
  The category should expand/collaspe and the search bar still has the focus.
  
  
Drag and drop dash icons
----------------------------
This test makes sure that.

#. Open the apps lens.
#. Drag a dash icon.
#. Now drop it inside the dash but on another icon or on a blank space.

Outcome
  The dropped icon should not have the keyboard focus and should not remain
  enlightened.
