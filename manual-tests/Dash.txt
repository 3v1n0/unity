Dash SearchBar middle-click
---------------------------
This test shows how the middle click over the dash search bar should work
(see lp:842462)

#. Open a text editor, and write some dummy text
#. Select some text part of the written dummy text with mouse
#. Press Super or Alt+F2 to open the Dash
#. Move the mouse over the dash search bar
#. Press middle click to paste the content of your primary clipboard

Outcome
  The text previously selected is pasted on the search bar at mouse pointer
  position, if the operation is repeated the text is inserted where
  the mouse pointer is.

Dash Spinner
------------
This tests that the spinner is properly shown when searching with the Dash.

#. Open the dash and type a string ("abc").

Outcome
  If the search is taking more than ~150ms, a spinner should be animating next
  to the search bar, once the spinner stops spinning the results shouldn't
  change.
