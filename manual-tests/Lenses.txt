Restarting of crashed lenses
----------------------------
This test makes sure that if a lens crashes, searching in the dash
automatically restarts it.

#. Open a terminal
#. Make sure there are some results in the apps lens
#. Kill the applications lens daemon in the terminal
   `killall /usr/lib/unity-lens-applications/unity-applications-daemon`
#. Open the dash and search for something (for example "gedit")

Outcome
Applications lens should automatically restart and gedit should be visible
in the results.
