Super Tap Timing on Slow Systems
--------------------------------
This test verifies that tap duration thresholding (unique to Super and Alt)
works on slow systems where previously it did not work reliably (LP: #953089).
The problems with Super tap timing have only been observed on slow and/or
heavily loaded systems, such as Atom-based netbooks.

#. Start with a clean login.
#. Load the CPU(s) by running one or more instances of this command in
   a terminal window(s):   while true; do true; done
#. Tap the Super key. Verify the Dash is shown.
#. Tap the Super key again. Verify the Dash is hidden.
#. Switch to a clear workspace (e.g. Ctrl+Alt+Right).
#. Tap the Super key again. Verify the Dash is shown again.
#. Tap the Super key again. Verify the Dash is hidden again.

Outcome:
  The Dash should appear and disappear in response to each tap on the Super
  key. Note that a tap is anything faster than 1/4 of a second. Any press
  that lasts longer than that is not considered a tap.
