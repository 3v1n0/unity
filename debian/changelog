  [ Chris Townsend ]
  * Add new signal to tell the Launcher to terminate keynav mode and use
    that signal when a BFB quicklist item is chosen. (LP: #1052024,
    #1444643)
  * Add option to enable and disable Unity low graphics mode on the fly
    in ccsm or via gsettings. (LP: #1412937)
  * Remove code that is no longer needed and broke opening application
    spread while in Launcher keynav mode. (LP: #1445082)
  * Save the active window when showing the Dash so the correct window
    is focused when hiding the Dash. Fixes issue when "Always on Top"
    windows are present. (LP: #1446634)

  * Send signal to ensure the Dash will show when entering keynav mode
    since the first icon always highlighted is the BFB. (LP: #1444113)
  * When looking for the top-most valid window in a VP, also check if
    the window is focused if the window is set to Always on Top. This
    allows Launcher icon spread to work properly when a window is
    minimized an Always on Top exists in the group. (LP: #1131385)
  * When using the left arrow to exit a Quicklist, Launcher keynav is
    implied and should be active regardless of how the Quicklist was
    opened. (LP: #1444626)

  [ Eleni Maria Stea ]
  * The skydome rendering of the cube plugin was wrong with unity
    because transformation matrices set by the unityshell plugin were
    left in the opengl matrix stacks affecting other compiz plugins.
    Saving the compiz state at the beginning of the unityshell plugin
    rendering functions and restoring it at the end of them fixes the
    problem. (LP: #1446165)

    and Previews. (LP: #1340996)
  * LockScreenShield: Add GrabScreen function and retry to make sure we
    really get grab It might happen that the grab is not possible
    because the PluginAdapter::IsScreenGrabbed request has still not
    being fully processed, and thus nux is not able to grab the
    pointer/keyboard. By doing this we instead try to grab the screen,
    and if this is not happening, we wait a little until we don't get

    value for any pixel size, the DPI value can be adjusted to the
    current logical one. From here, you can now get the correct pixel
    size based from of the EM value for the logical DPI of the screen.
  * Refactor EMConverter API. Now all thats needed is int
    ConvertPixels(int pixel); This will calculate the correct pixel size
    based on the DPI and font size.
  * Testing that the ibus anthy tests could possibly be causing strange
    issues on the nvidia machine. So skipping them to test if tihs is

  * Simple RawPixel class. It adds 2 define literals, ex: 10_em,
    10.0_em. From there it turns them into raw pixels. RawPixels have CP
    (CovertPixel) function which takes in an EMConverter that allows you
    to use a converter specific to a monitor to convert the raw pixel to
    the correct value.

  * Don't re-present all of our windows on every frame. Only do that if
    damage intersects it. Use the new APIs exposed by compiz and nux to
    intelligently determine which windows need to be presented per-frame
    and only register damage for those windows. This fixes two things:
    1. BaseWindows being redrawn from scratch every time damage was
    registered over them. That was incorrect and should only be done in
    the case of background blurs. 2. BaseWindows being drawn to the
    screen on every frame, regardless of whether or not they needed to
    be. Now they will only be drawn if some damage intersects beneath
    them. Note that unity will expand the damage region to accomadate
    the base window since nux does not support geometry clipping. So if
    there is a partial intersection of the launcher for example, the
    area of the screen which contains the launcher will be re-painted
    (but the launcher itself won't be redrawn, just its texture) (LP:
    #1080947). (LP: #1080947)
  * Convert compiz regions / rects to nux::Geometry's and back easily.
  * UnityScreen: remove the useless and expensive gl{Push,Pop}Attrib
    calls For some reasons this code was copied by the opengl plugin as
    a workaround to fix the state of our screen after that nux has
    drawn. Actually this is not needed, the only thing we really need to
    do is to fix the current Viewport, because nux seems to leave it in
    a bad state which would lead to flickering menus, fullscreen
    windows, tooltip and missing windows thumbnails in switcher. Thanks
    to Sam Spilsbury for his precious support. (LP: #1251275)
  * Unity: always prefer passing [this] to lambdas than [&].
  * Introspectable: use IntrospectionData class for collecting data from
    children Now each introspectable object is called with an
    IntrospectionData parameter and calling one of its methods it's the
    only way to fill introspection data into unity. As bonus point,
    remove all the unneeded UnityCore/Variant.cpp inclusions. (LP:
    #1227131)
  * DebugDBusInterface: add local::xpathselect::NodeSelector to use the
    dloaded lib.
  * BackgroundEffectHelper: Specify the required blur area before
    drawing so selectively copy it at paint time This means that we
    don't have to waste fragment bandwidth copying the entire backbuffer
    when we could just do parts of it. Now BackgroundEffectHelper
    listens to windows and views geometry changes and updates a list of
    blurred regions that might be copied to the backup texture at every
    repaint that affects them. This avoids to copy large regions
    (especially when using big resolutions or multiple monitors), but
    only the ones we really need to blur.
  * SwitcherView: define a custom GeometryGetterFunc and notify helper
    on changes Thanks to this the switcher won't make
    BackgroundEffectHelper to create a blurred area as big as the
    current monitor (with just a small padding), but an area big enough
    to draw its background. This get updated automagically when the
    switcher view changes its geometry... Also, use nux::AnimateValue
    for switcher animations, making compiz to orchestrate it and only
    redraw the view if an icon changed since the last progress
    iteration. We don't want the switcher to be drawn unless its
    geometry or an icon changes. Also we don't want to redraw the
    switcher multiple times if only a not-animated parameter of an icon
    (such as a pip or the selection glow) has changed. As bonus, reduce
    lots of list copies.
  * {Dash,Hud}Controller: unset the keyfocus area only if one of their
    children has the focus Otherwise we could steal the focus to another
    view (such as the Alt+Tab switcher). (LP: #1252760)
  * IntrospectionData: use forward declaration for nux classes, add
    support to glib::Variant We don't need to repeat the inclusion
    everywhere we want debug introspection. This allows also to add
    glib::Variant adder without the need of any other cast.
  * decorations: added new unity-decorations fully gtk-css-themed inside
    unity. (LP: #691817, #827537)
  * PanelMenuView: show a dropdown menu of indicators, if there's no
    enough horizontal space PanelService: add new dbus method
    ShowEntriesDropdown that when called puts the requested indicator
    entires into a DropDown menu before showing them, also threat
    dropdown menus as special entries when the their geometry has been
    synced. UnityCore: add add ShowEntriesDropdown virtual method as
    well and implement in DBusIndicators, to call the relative method in
    PanelService. Add parents to indicator::Entry, now an entry can have
    one or more parents (that's mostly depending on how many monitors we
    have), and if parented, it notifies active, show_now and geometry
    status to them. API cleanups included, SO-name bumped. PanelView:
    add simpler PreLayoutManagement function, to avoid nux to do too
    many computations that will cause the Menu to relayout too much with
    no need. Added PanelIndicatorEntryDropdownView as new subtype of
    PanelIndicatorEntryView that will show a go-down icon on the
    PanelMenuView that when clicked will show a dropdown menu of
    indicators. This will happen only if there's not enough room to see
    them inline. PanelIndicatorsView: many cleanups, and add
    EnableDropdownMenu that creates a new
    PanelIndicatorEntryDropdownView and uses it to place the entries
    that don't fit the available space, until we don't get some more.
    Added and reworked a bunch of unit tests. (LP: #1274554)
  * DecorationsInputMixer: pass Timestamp to events This might be needed
    to perform some actions, and using CompScreen getCurrentTime() is
    way much more expensive than I thought.
  * MenuManager: add a wrapper for Indicators and KeyGrabber that
    registers mnemonics It also emits signals with accumulators that
    will just stop the emission when a client returns true, and holds
    menu general settings.
  * LauncherDragWindow: set the drag window background to transparent or
    it will be white by default This was causing a quick flickering of
    the icon as soon as it was drawn on the first place. (LP: #1279904)

    active and visible states for the icon are correct and allow the AP
    tests to pass. (LP: #1274985)
  * Fixes some Autopilot Panel test failures: Emit the signal to call
    OnIndicatorViewUpdated() when the active window position has
    changed. Account for an overlay (Dash/Hud) to be opened when testing
    if the window buttons should be shown in the Panel. This was removed
    some revisions ago and it looks like it shouldn't have been. Fix up
    a Panel test since it was failing in a part that didn't need to be
    ran anyways. (LP: #1277265)
  * Fix a couple of test_panel AP tests: The overlay window buttons did
    not take multi-monitor into account, so now account for that. Fix
    the AP test themselves to actually use the correct introspection
    object.
  * Fix a failing Dash AP test due to too many results being returned
    which caused the position of the Dash icon to be off the screen.
  * Fix where the mouse_disabled_ variable was unintialized which would
    cause the Switcher to not work correctly with the mouse and arrow
    keys. Fix the mouse filter list to account for only motion and
    button click/release so arrow key navigation will still work in the
    Switcher when mouse interaction is disabled. (LP: #1279499)
  * Fix Autopilot test issue where Show Desktop is somehow invoked and
    the recovery from this does not properly get the state back to Show
    Desktop off.

  * Don't re-present all of our windows on every frame. Only do that if
    damage intersects it. Use the new APIs exposed by compiz and nux to
    intelligently determine which windows need to be presented per-frame
    and only register damage for those windows. This fixes two things:
    1. BaseWindows being redrawn from scratch every time damage was
    registered over them. That was incorrect and should only be done in
    the case of background blurs. 2. BaseWindows being drawn to the
    screen on every frame, regardless of whether or not they needed to
    be. Now they will only be drawn if some damage intersects beneath
    them. Note that unity will expand the damage region to accomadate
    the base window since nux does not support geometry clipping. So if
    there is a partial intersection of the launcher for example, the
    area of the screen which contains the launcher will be re-painted
    (but the launcher itself won't be redrawn, just its texture) (LP:
    #1080947). (LP: #1080947)

  * BackgroundEffectHelper: Specify the required blur area before
    drawing so selectively copy it at paint time This means that we
    don't have to waste fragment bandwidth copying the entire backbuffer
    when we could just do parts of it. Now BackgroundEffectHelper
    listens to windows and views geometry changes and updates a list of
    blurred regions that might be copied to the backup texture at every
    repaint that affects them. This avoids to copy large regions
    (especially when using big resolutions or multiple monitors), but
    only the ones we really need to blur.

  * Invalidate the Icon Centers when the monitor layout changes, so we
    make sure that if an icon center is set, then the icon is available

  [ Michal Hruby ]
  * When requesting a channel from scopes, use the DIFF flag, which will
    cause scopes machinery to do a diff between the old and new model
    states, so results that didn't change will stay in the model -
    previously they would be removed and re-added.

  * Show desktop now only works for individual workspaces. Also if any
    new windows are opened, or one is restored on that workspace then
    the next Show desktop will minimize those. The only time windows are
    restored are when no new windows have been mapped, and no windows
    have been restored for that workspace only. (LP: #966030)

  * ApplicationLauncherIcon: improve the way we override the Quit
    quicklist item If a quit action is defined in static (desktop file
    action) or dynamic way we use it to override the default one,
    placing it to the proper position. Also override more labels by
    default and if a quicklist item has the
    QuicklistMenuItem::QUIT_ACTION_PROPERTY (defined as "unity-quit-
    action") property set to TRUE, then we use this item as the quit
    quicklist item. Factorized the code we use to generate both static
    and dynamic ql items. (LP: #876421)

  * ConnectionManager: add a class container of sigc::connection that

    requests.

  [ Chris Townsend ]
  * Fixes some panel shadow regressions caused by rev. 3381. - No panel
    shadow when logging in, ie, no windows are opened. - Indicator drop
    down menus have the panel shadow painted over them. - Notification
    bubbles cause the panel shadow to be drawn on top of everything. -
    Minimizing all windows caused the panel shadow to not be drawn. (LP:

  * Handle StateNotFoundError when querying the label of a hud button.

  [ Łukasz 'sil2100' Zemczak ]
  * Now that we're using the new HUD, there have been some changes that
    typically cause test_hud tests to fail. Fix the tests to fit the new
    model. The first one is that generally we do not have indicator
    entries visible in the HUD anymore. Only application menu entries
    are in it now. The second one - the way the results are displayed is
    different. Now, instead of "Menu > Entry" we have "Entry (Menu)"
    etc.
  * Fix two HUD failures related to HUD slow action activation.
  * Fix some autopilot test failures, some related to test_shortcut_hint
    and some to test_scroll in launcher.
  * Modify all the hud_query_check lambdas to be more smart and error-
    checking. Same for the selected_hud_button method in the HUD
    emulator. Also, get rid of the troublesome test_gedit_undo and
    change it into test_gedit_save, which is easier to test and anyway
    tests what we want. Besides that we also now try to handle the
    StateNotFoundError exception in the HUD emulator, another cause of
    some AP failures.
  * Add a flag for -Wno-error=unused-local-typedefs, since this causes a
    FTBFS on ARM

    tests what we want. Besides that we also now try to handle the
    StateNotFoundError exception in the HUD emulator, another cause of

      have regular sizes. (LP: #1049217)
    - Register file delete events in zeitgeist when file is dropped onto Trash
      launcher icon. Added zeitgeist dependency. (LP: #870150)
