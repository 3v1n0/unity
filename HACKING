If you want to hack on unity you need the following packages
  - nux
  - libbamf
  - libdee
  - gio-2.0
  - dbusmenu-glib-0.4
  - gthread-2.0
  - indicator
  - atk
  - libutouch-geis

Or if you are on ubuntu run the command, apt-get build-dep unity

Unity uses the google coding style for any C++ code which can be found here:
http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml

When in doubt copy the coding style of the file you are editing.

Internal Documentation can be built for Unity by having doxygen installed and running make doxygen - its intended to give a high level understanding of the relationships between different parts of the code, not as a definitive API. doxygen generated files will be stored in api-docs/


To build Unity the latest Unity you should grab the source files from bzr with
  bzr branch lp:unity

then make a directory called build in unity directory. inside that directory run
  CMAKE ../
  make

Please note that this will create a systemwide install of unity, if you are developing localy (you are unless you know different) run 
  CMAKE -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/staging ../

changing ~/staging to suit wherever you want to install files locally
