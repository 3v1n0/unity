Notes on unity development:

Quicklist desktop file specification:
  Adding a new quicklist entry requires modifiying the desktop file of the
  application the quicklist belongs to. You will need to create a new group
  named Quicklist Entry UID, with UID being a unique id (in the scope of the
  desktop file).
  An example follows:

[Desktop Entry]
...
...
...

[QuickList Entry 1]
Name=FooBar Action
Exec=foobar --thingone

[QuickList Entry 2]
Name=FooBar Second Action
Exec=foobar --thingtwo

[QuickList Entry 3]
Name=FooBar Third Action
Exec=foobar --thingthree

  Name and Exec follow standard Desktop file specifications and can be
  translated in the same mannar as standard desktop files.
