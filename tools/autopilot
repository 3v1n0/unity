echo "Autopilot has moved! 

Autopilot used to be part of the unity source tree. It's now it's own launchpad 
project. To install it, you need to execute the following: 

 sudo add-apt-repository ppa:autopilot/ppa
 sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install python-autopilot 
 
Make sure the tests/autopilot/ directory is in your PYTHONPATH. Then, to list 
all the autopilot tests in the unity package, run:

 autopilot list unity 
 
To run all the unity tests:

 autopilot run unity
 
Note that for both these commands to work, you must have the tests/autopilot 
directory in your PYTHONPATH environment variable."
