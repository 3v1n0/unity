• Installation

• Tests

  - You can run `make check` in the build directory to run all GTester tests
  - In the build directory, ./tests/test-panel will start the panel in
    standalone mode, which is great for testing

• Environmental Variables

  PANEL_USE_LOCAL_SERVICE=${anything}
    Makes the panel run the unity-panel-service directly instead of through
    D-Bus activation. This is used for testing how the panel reacts when it
    starts before the service does.
