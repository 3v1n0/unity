/**
 * glib::Source is a wrapper class made to handle GSource based events at C++
 * level.
 *
 * The class is basically to be intended abstract and is currently implemented
 * by glib::Timeout() and glib::Idle() that are the higher-level wrappers for
 * g_timeout and g_idle respectively.
 *
 * As this is meant to be mostly a wrapper, I've mostly kept the same logic of
 * the glib sources, and so, for example, a source can't be ran more than once.
 *
 * Sources should define a callback function that will be called every time that
 * the source is dispatched. If the callback function returns false, then the
 * source will be removed, otherwise it will continue.
 *
 * Pointer types have been defined and should be used to handle dynamically
 * allocated sources. They also implicitly allow to remove running Sources
 * by setting their value to nullptr.
